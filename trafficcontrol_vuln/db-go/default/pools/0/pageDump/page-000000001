 It then picks the first address in that interface. Returns the selected interface name, the selected address, and any error. SendPacket sends the given packet to the given address and port. Note this doesn't take the local IP:port, which will be the source, which the destination will reply to, Because those must already be included in the packet. Returns the time immediately before the packet was sent, and any error. Note this doesn't include the port. When dialing tcp, net.Dial addr must include the port. But when dialing ip, the addr must not include the port. Rather, the port will be determined from the dest port in the packet. receiveSAR receives the Syn-Ack in response to the Syn, with the given timeout. Upon receiving a SynAck, it sends a RST to help the remote discard the connection quickly, and stops caring. The srcPort, dstPort, and ackNum are used to match the SYNACK packet. Returns the time that the SynAck was received. TODO should this return an error? We were expecting a syn-ack, not a reset sendRST sends a tcp reset. This is designed to be called immediately after getting the syn-ack for the syn-ack-rst health check, to help the remote host close the connection quickly and gracefully. The seqNum must be the sequence number of the original syn packet plus 1.

Users constructing a TCPHdr and giving it to a trusting caller must ensure it is at least 20 bytes and valid. Users receiving an untrusted TCPHdr must check it is at least 20 bytes. This type and its functions do not check size or validity, for performance reasons, and therefore may panic if the TCPHdr is too small or otherwise malformed. Note TCPHdr does no validation of any kind, and is completely unaware of the contents of the packet, including the semantics of any TCP Options. For a more convenient but slower implementation, use TCPHdrDecoded (TODO implement) See Valid. DataOffset is the DOffset TCP field. See RFC9293§3.1. Note the Data Offset field is 4 bits; unfortunately, uint8 is the smallest Go type. Therefore, the most significant 4 bits will be unused and are not part of the field. don't need an Endian convertion, it's just a single byte We could just not do this mask. Callers shouldn't be looking at the higher bits anyway. Is this ever a security issue? Reserved is the reserved TCP field. See RFC9293§3.1. Note the Reserved field is 4 bits; unfortunately, uint8 is the smallest Go type. Control is the control flag TCP fields: CWR, ECE, URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN. This provided for convenience and performance, when bit-shifting is faster or more convenient than using booleans. Each control flag is also available via individual boolean funcs. CWR is the Congestion Window Reduced flag, part of the ECN Explicit Congestion Notification. See RFC3168§6.1, RFC9293§3.1. ECE is the ECN-Echo flag, part of the ECN Explicit Congestion Notification. URG is the Urgent flag. See RFC9293§3.1. ACK is the Acknowledgement flag. See RFC9293§3.1. PSH is the Push flag. See RFC9293§3.1, RFC9293§3.9.1 RST is the connection Reset flag. See RFC9293§3.1. SYN is the synchronize sequence numbers flag. See RFC9293§3.1. FIN is the finish connection flag. See RFC9293§3.1. OptionKind returns the kind of the nth option. See RFC9293§3.2. The prevSize is the sum of the sizes of all options less than n. This is necessary to find the next option. Note the End of Option List the last option is of kind 0. So to iterate over all options, continuously request Option(prevSize, n) (tracking the sum of the previous sizes) until the returned option Kind is 0. Note per RFC9293§3.2 all options except kind 0 (End of Option) and kind 1 (No Operation) have lengths. Callers must detect this and not query OptionLength for Kind 0 or 1. See RFC9293§3.2 for more details. single byte, no Endian conversion OptionLen returns the kind of the nth option. See RFC9293§3.2. Note per RFC9293§3.2 all options except kind 0 (End of Option) and kind 1 (No Operation) have lengths. Callers must detect this and not query OptionLen for Kind 0 or 1. OptionData returns the data of the nth option. See RFC9293§3.2. Note per RFC9293§3.2 all options except kind 0 (End of Option) and kind 1 (No Operation) have lengths. Callers must detect this and not query OptionLength or OptionData for Kind 0 or 1. Note the Option Length includes the Kind and Length fields, each 1 octet. Therefore, options of length 2 have no data. Options of length <=2 must not call OptionData. The optionLen is the Length field. Note the Option Length includes the Kind and Length. The optionLen must not be the length of the data, it must be the Option Length field. Therefore, the returned data will be 2 octets less than optionLen. Note the OptionLength includes padding. Therefore, the data returned by this func will include padding, in addition to the semantic option data. This func is unaware of the semantics of any options. Note the OptionsData bytes are returned in network byte order (Big Endian), not machine byte order (frequently Little Endian). Because TCPHdr doesn't know about options, it lacks the context to know the sizes and locations of integers inside particular options, and therefore cannot convert byte order. Callers must convert byte order as necessary. See the binary package. ProtocolNumberTCP is the protocol number for TCP. See IANA Protocol Numbers, RFC791. MakeTCPChecksum creates the TCP packet checksum. See RFC9293§3.1 TODO validate sourceIP and destIP are either 4 or 16 len? TCP Checksum includes an IP "psuedo-header" (to protect against mis-routed packets).

MarkdownServer contains symbols for manipulating a running MarkdownService started by StartMarkdownService. Shutdown signals the MarkdownService to stop its goroutines and release all resources. It is not buffered. Writes will block until the markdown service is done with any ongoing markdown operation. Once a write returns, the MarkdownService will begin shutdown. TODO: add signal to callers when shutdown has finished. UpdateHealth signals to the markdown service that health status has changed, and it should process markdowns again. decideHealthy is the algorithm for deciding whether a cache is healthy. It takes the cache hostname, and all health results, and returns a single boolean decision. TODO use hostname:port? Parents can be healthy on one port/service but not another. The ATS markdown command can't mark down per-port as of this writing, but we can at least calculate it, to log that data, and be able to easily mark down host:port when ATS adds that. note the CacheStatuses has v4 and v6 data, but ATS also can't mark down hosts per IP version yet, so we just use the generic/old non-IP-versioned IsAvailable field.

Maybe it doesn't matter for pessimistic health? nilOrTrue is a helper func that returns true if the given *bool is nil or true. This is used for pessimistic health, but if the health doesn't exist for the parent for a particular health type poller, we don't want to mark it unhealthy. pessimistic: if any health mechanism is unhealthy, consider the host unhealthy decideRecursiveHealthy is the algorithm for deciding whether a parent is healthy, based on a heuristic of whether it can get to most parents Note this is a heuristic because ATS doesn't currently have the ability to mark down a parent hostname for a single remap. If and when ATS has the ability to mark down parents per-remap, we can mark down parents just for remaps whose origins aren't available on that parent. TODO get direct vs final parent data from strategies.yaml and parent.config      Because we really want to heuristically check only the final parents (i.e. origins)      are available on our direct parent, not any other origins it has that aren't assigned      to this cache. TODO this is currently pessimistic: if any health mechanism is unhealthy, consider unhealthy.      make health decision configurable. getParentFQDNs returns the FQDN of all parents in all health types. This is necessary, because some health polls might not have parents, so we need to combine them all put FQDns in a set first, to remove duplicates this should be normal. Many parents in TM won't be parents of this cache we don't need recursive health, just the direct parent. We only need direct parents to mark down. HealthSafetyRatio is the ratio of unhealthy parents after which no parents will be marked down.

For ATS version 9, this will be auto updated to 1 ParentInfo contains the necessary data required to keep track of trafficserver config files, lists of parents a trafficserver instance uses, and directory locations used for configuration and trafficserver executables. All AtomicPtr members MUST NOT be modified. All AtomicPtr members are accessed concurrently by multiple goroutines, and their objects must be atomically replaced by a single writer, and never modified. ParentHostFQDNs maps hostnames to fqdns, of parents. This is necessary because Traffic Monitor's CRStates API only maps hostnames to health, which is mostly okay for CDN caches; but we can't key on hostname anywhere else, because hostnames for non-cache parents aren't unique or meaningful. So, we key on FQDN everywhere, and this mapping is used to map TM hostnames to their FQDNs. Don't use this for anything that includes non-cache (origin) servers. Hostnames for any servers but caches are not unique and cannot be used as keys. TOData is the Traffic Ops data needed by various services. set[fqdn] Clone copies the TOData into a new object. Note the TOClient, which is safe for use by multiple goroutines, is not copied. CombineParentHealth takes a ParentHealth directly queried from the parent service (ATS or the Origin) and the ParentServiceHealth directly queried from the parent's HealthService, combines them, and returns a ParentServiceHealth with each direct parent's RecursiveParentHealth containing both the direct ParentHealth and the ParentServiceHealth. If any parent exists in the direct ParentHealth but not ParentServiceHealth (which may be common, if cache parents aren't running the Health Service; and will always be true for origin parents), the direct parent will be inserted into the ParentServiceHealth. If any parent exists in the ParentServiceHealth but not ParentHealth, that means the actual parent service (ATS or the Origin) was unreachable, even though the Parent Health Service was reachable. In which case, we don't want to ever consider that parent healthy, so it will not be included. have to copy, we aren't allowed to modify the ParentHealth or ParentServiceHealth (because there are many concurrent readers). generally both L4 and L7 health should always exist, but this might occur if the service just started, or just got a new parent, and it hasn't had time to poll both yet TODO warn/err if parent is in parentHealth but not parentServiceHealth? And the reverse? LoadParentStatus returns parent's status and whether the parent existed. It is safe for multiple goroutines. StoreParentStatus Sets a parent's status. GetParents returns a list of parent FQDNs. The map of parents is not locked during execution, so if the map data is changed concurrently, whether or not changes are returned will be nondeterministic. GetCacheParents returns a list of parent FQDNs which are caches (as opposed to origins). See GetParents for concurrency and other details. TODO make this smarter. log.Debugf("GetCacheParents parent '%v' not in caches, skipping\n", parent.Fqdn) skip parents that aren't caches (i.e. origins) LoadOrStoreParentStatus adds the given status if fqdn does not exist, and returns the existing value if it does exist. Returns true if the value was loaded, false if it was stored. This behaves identical to sync.Map.LoadOrStore. when reading the 'strategies.yaml', these fields are used to help parse out fail_over objects. the fields used from 'strategies.yaml' that describe a parent. the protocol object in 'strategies.yaml' that help to describe a parent. a trafficserver strategy object from 'strategies.yaml'. the top level array defintions in a trafficserver 'strategies.yaml' used at startup to load a trafficservers list of parents from it's 'parent.config', 'strategies.yaml' and current parent status from trafficservers HostStatus subsystem. read the 'parent.config'. read the strategies.yaml. collect the trafficserver parent status from the HostStatus subsystem. TODO remove old parents no longer in parent.config, strategies.yaml, or traffic_ctl host status log.Infof("startup loaded %d parent records\n", len(parentStatus)) TODO track how many elements are in the map? Used by the polling function to update the parents list from changes to 'parent.config' and 'strategies.yaml'.

TODO make deterministic. Hash of hostname? parse out the hostname of a parent listed in parents.config or 'strategies.yaml'. the hostname can be an IP address. not an IP, get the hostname use the IP addr readParentConfig loads the parents list from the Trafficserver 'parent.config' file. skip blank lines skip comment lines, 35 is a '#'. search for the parent list. 'parent.config' parent separators are ';' or ','. parse the parent list to get each hostName and it's associated port. create the ParentStatus struct and add it to the Parents map only if an entry in the map does not already exist. load the parent hosts from 'strategies.yaml'. open the strategies file for scanning. search for any yaml files that should be included in the yaml stream. load all included and 'strategies yaml' files to the yamlContent. If we are to not monitor peers, this will set the hosts to non-peer hosts only Empty the hosts since we want to rebuild GetTOData fetches data needed from Traffic Ops and refreshes it in the ParentInfo object. Note it takes a Config, even though ParentInfo has a AtomicPtr[Config], because callers typically need to atomically operate on a single Config. If a caller doesn't already have a Config, simply call pi.GetTOData(pi.Cfg.Get()). TODO can we use the t3c cache here? next time we'll login again and get a new session. Provide logging around a potential issue readHostStatus reads the current parent statuses from the trafficserver HostStatus subsystem. auto select traffic_ctl command for ATS version 9 or 10 and later ATS version 10 and later ATS version 9

NopWriter is a no-op io.WriteCloser. It always returns the length of the given bytes as written. Writes to this go nowhere. Close may be called, and is also a no-op. WriteNoCloser wraps an io.Writer and returns an io.WriteCloser for which Close will be a no-op. This allows for passing a WriteCloser to something that ordinarily takes ownership and closes, Without that Close() closing the real Writer. For example, to prevent closing os.Stdout. This can also be used to turn an io.Writer into an io.WriteCloser. AtomicPtr provides atomic getting and setting of a pointer. It may be default-constructed or via NewAtomicPtr. It must not be copied after first use. No further synchronization is provided, besides the atomic pointer exchange. If value pointed to is modified concurrently, users must perform their own synchronization. NewAtomicPtr creates a new AtomicPtr[T] initialized with ptr. Get returns the pointer. This is safe for multiple concurrent goroutines. If the returned object is modified concurrently, users must perform their own synchronization. Set sets the AtomicPtr's pointer. If the set object is modified concurrently, users must perform their own synchronization SyncMap is a strongly-typed sync.Map.

It is the Stats format produced by the `astats` plugin to Apache Traffic Server, included with Traffic Control. Stats are of the form `{"ats": {"name", number}}`, Where `name` is of the form:   `"plugin.remap_stats.fully-qualfiied-domain-name.example.net.stat-name"` Where `stat-name` is one of:   `in_bytes`, `out_bytes`, `status_2xx`, `status_3xx`, `status_4xx`, `status_5xx` AstatsSystem represents fixed system stats returned from the 'astats_over_http' ATS plugin. Astats contains ATS data returned from the Astats ATS plugin. This includes generic stats, as well as fixed system stats. TODO: what's using these?? Can we get rid of them? astatsProcessStat and its subsidiary functions act as a State Machine, the FQDN is `subsubdomain`.`subdomain`.`domain`. For a HTTP Delivery Service, `subsubdomain` will be the cache hostname; for a DNS Delivery Service, it will be `edge`.

NewHandler returns a new cache handler. Note this handler does NOT precompute stat data before calling ResultChan, and Result.Precomputed will be nil. NewPrecomputeHandler constructs a new cache Handler, which precomputes stat data and populates result.Precomputed before passing to ResultChan. Precompute returns whether this handler precomputes data before passing the result to the ResultChan PrecomputedData represents data parsed and pre-computed from the Result. This is the total bytes transmitted by all interfaces on the Cache Server. MaxKbps is the maximum bandwidth of all interfaces on the Cache Server, each one calculated as the speed of the interface in Kbps. Result is a result of polling a cache server for statistics. Available indicates whether or not the cache server should be considered "available" based on its status as configured in Traffic Ops, the cache server's own reported availability (if applicable), and the polled vitals and statistics as compared to threshold values. Error holds what error - if any - caused the statistic polling to fail. ID is the fully qualified domain name of the cache server being polled. (This is assumed to be unique even though that isn't necessarily true) Miscellaneous contains the stats that were not directly gathered into Statistics, but were still found in the stats polling payload. Their contents are NOT guaranteed in ANY way. PollFinished is a channel to which data should be sent to indicate that polling has been completed and a Result has been produced. PollID is a unique identifier for the specific polling instance that produced this Result. RequestTime holds the elapsed duration between making a statistics polling request and either receiving a result or giving up. Statistics holds the parsed statistic data returned by the cache server. Time is the time at which the result has been obtained. UsingIPv4 indicates whether IPv4 can/should be/was used by the polling instance that produced this Result. If ``false'', it may be assumed that IPv6 was used instead. Vitals holds the parsed health information returned by the cache server. InterfaceVitals holds the parsed health information returned by the cache server per interface. HasStat returns whether the given stat is in the Result. health poll has all computed stats InterfacesNames returns the names of all network interfaces used by the cache server that was monitored to obtain the result. Interfaces returns the interfaces assigned to this result. Vitals is the vitals data returned from a cache. LoadAvg is the one-minute "loadavg" of the cache server. Stat is a generic stat, including the untyped value and the time the stat was taken. Filter filters whether stats and caches should be returned from a data set. StatComputeFunc functions calculate a specific statistic given a set of polling results, server and profile information, whether or not the server is available, and the name of the specific network interface for which stats will be computed. ComputedStats returns a map of cache stats which are computed by Traffic Monitor (rather than returned literally from ATS), mapped to the function to compute them. if the cache is missing, default to false These are back-up values for when a statistics format doesn't support reporting these stats - which would make sense because five of them are pre-parsed in Statistics structures already, and I'm not sure what the rest of them are even for.

SetAvailablility sets two booleans to indicate whether IPv4 is available and whether IPv6 is available. AvailableStatus is the available status of the given cache. It includes a boolean available/unavailable flag, and a descriptive string. Available indicates whether a Cache Server is available for various IP protocol versions. The name of the actual status the cache server has, as configured in `Why` will contain the reason a cache server has been purposely marked unavailable by a Traffic Ops operator, if indeed that has occurred. UnavailableStat is the stat whose threshold made the cache unavailable. If this is the empty string, the cache is unavailable for a non-threshold reason. This exists so a poller (health, stat) won't mark an unavailable cache as available if the stat whose threshold was reached isn't available on that poller. Poller is the name of the poller which set this availability status. CacheAvailableStatuses is the available status of each cache. Copy copies this CacheAvailableStatuses. It does not modify, and thus is safe for multiple reader goroutines. ResultHistory is a map of cache names, to an array of result history from each cache server. Copy copies returns a deep copy of this ResultHistory. TODO determine if anything ever needs more than the latest, and if not, change ResultInfo to not be a slice. ResultInfo contains all the non-stat result info. This includes the cache ID, any errors, the time of the poll, the request time duration, Astats System (Vitals), Poll ID, and Availability. TODO: Determine why this exists, it doesn't seem to differ from Result in any meaningful way. TODO determine if copy is necessary Kbpses is the kbps values of each interface of a cache server.

DSStats are referenced by name in a map associated with cache server data, and so that name (XMLID) is not reiterated here. InBytes is the total number of bytes received by the cache server which were for the Delivery Service. OutBytes is the total number of bytes transmitted by the cache server in service of the Delivery Service. Status2xx is the number of requests for the Delivery Service's content that were served with responses having response codes on the interval [200, 300). Status3xx is the number of requests for the Delivery Service's content [300, 400). Status4xx is the number of requests for the Delivery Service's content [400, 500). [500, 600). Loadavg contains the parsed "loadavg" data for a polled cache server. Specifically, it contains all of the data stored that can be found in /proc/loadavg on a Linux/Unix system. For more information on what a "loadavg" is, consult the “proc(5)” man page (web-hosted: https://linux.die.net/man/5/proc). One is the cache server's "loadavg" in the past minute from the time it was polled. Five is the cache server's "loadavg" in the past five minutes from the time it was polled. Fifteen is the cache server's "loadavg" in the past fifteen minutes from the time it was polled. CurrentProcesses is the number of currently executing processes (or threads) on the cache server. Note that stats_over_http doesn't provide this, so in general it can't be relied on to be set properly. TotalProcesses is the number of total processes (or threads) that exist on the cache server. LatestPID is the process ID of the most recently created process on the cache server at the time of polling. relied on to be set properly - which is fine because what use could that information actually have?? LoadavgFromRawLine parses a raw line - presumably read from /proc/loadavg - and returns a Loadavg containing all of the same information, as well as any encountered error. Interface represents a network interface. The name of the interface is used to access it within a Statistics object, and so is not stored here. Speed is the "speed" of the interface, which is of unknown - but vitally important - meaning. BytesOut is the total number of bytes transmitted by this interface. BytesIn is the total number of bytes received by this interface. Statistics is a structure containing, most generally, the statistics of a cache server. Loadavg contains the Unix/Linux "loadavg" values for the cache server. Interfaces is a map of network interface names to statistic data about those interfaces. NotAvailable reports whether or not the cache server is unavailable. Sometimes caches can directly report this, but it's not supported by stats_over_http (afaik), so it always just uses ``false'' AddInterfaceFromRawLine parses the raw line - presumably read from /proc/net/dev - and inserts into the Statistics a new Interface containing the data provided. This will initialize s.Interfaces if that has not already been done (if the parse is successful). If the line cannot be parsed, s.Interfaces is unchanged and an error describing the problem is returned. Note that this does *not* set the interface's Speed./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/cache/stats_over_http.gosohDataglobalDatastatValrxBytestxBytesifacesparsedStattrimmedStatstats_over_http"stats_over_http"`json:"global"`stats Content-Type (%s) can not be parsed by statsOverHTTP"stats Content-Type (%s) can not be parsed by statsOverHTTP"No 'global' data object found in stats_over_http payload"No 'global' data object found in stats_over_http payload"Error parsing loadavg for cache '%s': %v"Error parsing loadavg for cache '%s': %v"no valid data found in stats_over_http payload with csv format"no valid data found in stats_over_http payload with csv format"plugin.system_stats.loadavg.one"plugin.system_stats.loadavg.one"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.loadavg.one'"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.loadavg.one'"loadavg.one could not parse to float, was '%v' (%v)"loadavg.one could not parse to float, was '%v' (%v)"loadavg.one had unrecognized type '%T'"loadavg.one had unrecognized type '%T'"plugin.system_stats.loadavg.five"plugin.system_stats.loadavg.five"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.loadavg.five'"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.loadavg.five'"loadavg.five could not parse to float, was '%v' (%v)"loadavg.five could not parse to float, was '%v' (%v)"loadavg.five had unrecognized type '%T'"loadavg.five had unrecognized type '%T'"plugin.system_stats.loadavg.fifteen"plugin.system_stats.loadavg.fifteen"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.loadavg.fifteen'"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.loadavg.fifteen'"loadavg.fifteen could not parse to float, was '%v' (%v)"loadavg.fifteen could not parse to float, was '%v' (%v)"loadavg.fifteen had unrecognized type '%T'"loadavg.fifteen had unrecognized type '%T'"plugin.system_stats.current_processes"plugin.system_stats.current_processes"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.current_processes'"Data was missing 'plugin.system_stats.current_processes'"MaxUint6418446744073709551616current number of processes cannot be represented as a uint64 - too big (%v)"current number of processes cannot be represented as a uint64 - too big (%v)"current_processes cannot be negative, got %v"current_processes cannot be negative, got %v"current_processes could not parse to uint64, was '%v' (%v)"current_processes could not parse to uint64, was '%v' (%v)"current_processes had unrecognized type '%T'"current_processes had unrecognized type '%T'"plugin.system_stats.net."plugin.system_stats.net."stat '%s' appears to be network related, but is not an interface"stat '%s' appears to be network related, but is not an interface"rx_bytes"rx_bytes"received bytes for interface '%s' cannot be represented as a uint64 - too big (%v)"received bytes for interface '%s' cannot be represented as a uint64 - too big (%v)"received bytes for interface '%s' was negative (%v)"received bytes for interface '%s' was negative (%v)"received bytes for interface '%s' cannot parse as uint64, was '%v' (%v)"received bytes for interface '%s' cannot parse as uint64, was '%v' (%v)"received bytes for interface '%s' had unrecognized type '%T'"received bytes for interface '%s' had unrecognized type '%T'"tx_bytes"tx_bytes"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' cannot be represented as a uint64 - too big (%v)"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' cannot be represented as a uint64 - too big (%v)"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' was negative (%v)"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' was negative (%v)"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' cannot parse as uint64, was '%v' (%v)"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' cannot parse as uint64, was '%v' (%v)"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' had unrecognized type '%T'"transmitted bytes for interface '%s' had unrecognized type '%T'""speed"MinInt64-9223372036854775808speed of interface '%s' outside of representable integer range: %v"speed of interface '%s' outside of representable integer range: %v"speed of interface '%s' cannot parse to int64, was '%v': %v"speed of interface '%s' cannot parse to int64, was '%v': %v"speed for interface '%s' had unrecognized type '%T'"speed for interface '%s' had unrecognized type '%T'"value was negative"value was negative"value out of range for uint64"value out of range for uint64"could not parse '%v' to uint64: %v"could not parse '%v' to uint64: %v"value '%v' is of unrecognized type %T"value '%v' is of unrecognized type %T"No Delivery Service match for stat"No Delivery Service match for stat"Empty Delivery Service FQDN"Empty Delivery Service FQDN"couldn't parse numeric stat: %v"couldn't parse numeric stat: %v"Unknown stat '%s'"Unknown stat '%s'" LOADAVG_SHIFT is the amount by which "loadavg" values returned by stats_over_http need to be divided to obtain the values with which ATC operators are more familiar. The reason for this is that the Linux kernel stores loadavg values as integral types internally, and performs conversions to floating-point numbers on-the-fly when the contents of /proc/loadavg are read. Since astats_over_http used to always just read that file to get the numbers, everyone's used to the floating-point form. But stats_over_http gets the numbers directly from a syscall, so they aren't pre-converted for us. Dividing by this number is kind of a shortcut, for the actual transformation used by the kernel itself, refer to the source: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/proc/loadavg.c The form of the output isn't fully documented, so when something isn't of the right form you don't KNOW something went wrong; it could just be that you're not looking at what you think you're looking at. So when that happens we issue a warning and continue./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/cache/stats_types.goparserprecomputerNo decoder registered for format '%s'"No decoder registered for format '%s'" Package cache contains definitions for mechanisms used to extract health and statistics data from cache-server-provided data. The most commonly used format is the “stats_over_http” format provided by the plugin of the same name for Apache Traffic Server, followed closely by “astats”  which is the legacy format used by older versions of Apache Traffic Control. # Creating A New Stats Type To create a new Stats Type, for a custom caching proxy with its own stats format:  1. Create a file for your type in the traffic_monitor/cache directory and     package, `github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_monitor/cache/`  2. Create Parse and (optionally) Precompute functions in your file, with the     signature of `StatisticsParser` and `StatisticsPrecomputer`, respectively  3. In your file's special `init` func, call `registerDecoder` with your two     functions to register the new format. The name of the format MUST be     unique!  4. To apply the new parsing format to a cache server, set its Profile's     “health.polling.format“ Parameter's Value to the name of the desired     format. Your Parser should take the raw bytes from the `io.Reader` and populate the raw stats from them. It needs to provide (nearly) all of the data in a Statistics structure. Specifically, the available statistics MUST include:   - One-minute "loadavg" value for the cache server. The others are optional,     as we only use the one-minute value for health checks.   - At least one network interface (which will be considered the one used for     routing, and if multiple "monitored" network interfaces are configured for     the cache server in Traffic Ops they MUST all be present) and specifically     its name, “speed”, and bytes in and out. Parsers SHOULD return an error     if at least one interface cannot be found in the payload data.   - If your format does not directly indicate if the cache server is available     then NotAvailable should just be set to “false”. All other statistics (e.g. Delivery Service stats) should be returned in the map of statistic names to their values. Your Precomputer should take the Statistics and other miscellaneous stats that your Parser created, and populate the PrecomputedData. It is essential that all PrecomputedData fields are populated, especially `DeliveryServiceStats`, as they are used for cache and Delivery Service availability and threshold computation. If PrecomputedData is not properly and fully populated, the cache's availability will not be properly computed. Note the PrecomputedData `Reporting` and `Time` fields are the exception: they do not need to be set, and will be forcibly overridden by the Handler after your Precomputer function returns. Note these functions will not be called for Health polls, only Stat polls. Your Cache should have two separate stats endpoints: a small light endpoint returning only system stats and used to quickly verify reachability, and a large endpoint with all stats. If your cache does not have two stat endpoints, you may use your large stat endpoint for the Health poll, and configure the Health poll interval to be arbitrarily slow. These are controlled by the “health.polling.url' Parameter in Traffic Ops. Note your stats functions SHOULD NOT reuse functions from other stats types, even if they are similar, or have identical helper functions. This is a case where "duplicate" code is acceptable, because it's not conceptually duplicate. You don't want your stat parsers to break if the similar stats format you reuse code from changes. StatsDecoder is a pair of functions registered for decoding statistics of a particular format, and parsing that data and precomputing related data, respectively. StatisticsParser is a function that parses raw input data for a given statistics format and returns the meaningful statistics. In addition to the decoded statistics, the decoder should also return whatever miscellaneous data was in the payload but not represented by the properties of a Statistics object, so that it can be used in later calculations if necessary. StatisticsPrecomputer is a function that "pre-computes" some statistics beyond the basic ones covered by a Statistics object. Precomputers aren't called until a statistics poll is done, whereas basic Statistics are calculated even for Health polls. GetDecoder gets a decoder for the given statistic format. Returns an error if no parser for the given format exists./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/cache/vstats.go"vstats"%s handler got nil reader"%s handler got nil reader"failed to decode reader data: %w"failed to decode reader data: %w"failed to add interface data %s: %w"failed to add interface data %s: %w"failed to read average load data %s: %w"failed to read average load data %s: %w" Vstats holds Varnish cache statistics/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/config/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/config/config.goBothGetAccessLogWriterGetStaticAppDataHTTPPollingFormatIPv4OnlyIPv6OnlyInvalidPollingProtocolLoadBytesPollingProtocolPollingProtocolFromStringStaticAppDatagetHostNameWithoutDomainCachePollingProtocoljson:"cache_polling_protocol"json:"crconfig_backup_file"CRConfigHistoryCountjson:"crconfig_history_count"DistributedPollingjson:"distributed_polling"HealthFlushIntervaljson:"http_polling_format"HTTPTimeoutLogLocationAccessjson:"log_location_access"MaxEventsjson:"max_events"MonitorConfigPollingIntervalPeerOptimisticQuorumMinjson:"peer_optimistic_quorum_min"ServeReadTimeoutServeWriteTimeoutShortHostnameOverridejson:"short_hostname_override"StatBufferIntervalStatFlushIntervaljson:"static_file_dir"StatPollingjson:"stat_polling"json:"tmconfig_backup_file"TrafficOpsDiskRetryMaxjson:"traffic_ops_disk_retry_max"TrafficOpsMaxRetryIntervalTrafficOpsMinRetryIntervalAccessLogaccessLocaux/opt/traffic_monitor/crconfig.backup"/opt/traffic_monitor/crconfig.backup"/opt/traffic_monitor/tmconfig.backup"/opt/traffic_monitor/tmconfig.backup"ipv4only"ipv4only"ipv6only"ipv6only"invalid_polling_protocol"invalid_polling_protocol"parsed invalid PollingProtocol: "parsed invalid PollingProtocol: "`json:"cache_polling_protocol"``json:"crconfig_backup_file"``json:"crconfig_history_count"``json:"distributed_polling"``json:"http_polling_format"``json:"log_location_access"``json:"max_events"``json:"peer_optimistic_quorum_min"``json:"short_hostname_override"``json:"static_file_dir"``json:"stat_polling"``json:"tmconfig_backup_file"``json:"traffic_ops_disk_retry_max"`getting log access writer %v: %v"getting log access writer %v: %v"200000000MonitorConfigPollingIntervalMsjson:"monitor_config_polling_interval_ms"HTTPTimeoutMSjson:"http_timeout_ms"HealthFlushIntervalMsjson:"health_flush_interval_ms"StatFlushIntervalMsjson:"stat_flush_interval_ms"StatBufferIntervalMsjson:"stat_buffer_interval_ms"ServeReadTimeoutMsjson:"serve_read_timeout_ms"ServeWriteTimeoutMsjson:"serve_write_timeout_ms"`json:"monitor_config_polling_interval_ms"``json:"http_timeout_ms"``json:"health_flush_interval_ms"``json:"stat_flush_interval_ms"``json:"stat_buffer_interval_ms"``json:"serve_read_timeout_ms"``json:"serve_write_timeout_ms"`TrafficOpsMinRetryIntervalMsjson:"traffic_ops_min_retry_interval_ms"TrafficOpsMaxRetryIntervalMsjson:"traffic_ops_max_retry_interval_ms"`json:"traffic_ops_min_retry_interval_ms"``json:"traffic_ops_max_retry_interval_ms"`invalid configuration: stat_polling cannot be enabled if distributed_polling is also enabled"invalid configuration: stat_polling cannot be enabled if distributed_polling is also enabled" LogLocationStdout indicates the stdout IO stream LogLocationStderr indicates the stderr IO stream LogLocationNull indicates the null IO stream (/dev/null)StaticFileDir is the directory that contains static html and js files.CrConfigBackupFile is the default file name to store the last crconfigTmConfigBackupFile is the default file name to store the last tmconfigHTTPPollingFormat is the default accept encoding for stats from caches PollingProtocol is a string value indicating whether to use IPv4, IPv6, or both.

See the `NewCacheStatFilter` documentation for details on which query parameters are used to filter. UseCache returns whether the given cache is in the filter. UseStat returns whether the given stat is in the filter. WithinStatHistoryMax returns whether the given history index is less than the max history of this filter. NewCacheStatFilter takes the HTTP query parameters and creates a CacheStatFilter which fulfills the `cache.Filter` interface, filtering according to the query parameters passed. Query parameters used are `hc`, `stats`, `wildcard`, `type`, and `hosts`. If `hc` is 0, all history is returned. If `hc` is empty, 1 history is returned. If `stats` is empty, all stats are returned. If `wildcard` is empty, `stats` is considered exact.

Right now, it's only the UnpolledCheck, but there may be others later. For example, security headers. This is the "spirit" of how TM1.0 works; hack to extract a path argument to filter data (/publish/SomeEndpoint/:argument). HandleErr takes an error, and the request type it came from, and logs. It is ok to call with a nil error, in which case this is a no-op. WrapErrStatusCode takes the body, err, status code, and log context (errorCount, reqPath). It logs and deals with any error, and returns the appropriate bytes and response code for the `srvhttp`. It notably returns InternalServerError status on any error, for security reasons. WrapErrCode calls the WrapErrStatusCode function with a hardcoded 500. This is a convenience function for callers that do not want to provide a status code. WrapBytes takes a function which cannot error and returns only bytes, and wraps it as a http.HandlerFunc. The errContext is logged if the write fails, and should be enough information to trace the problem (function name, endpoint, request parameters, etc). WrapErr takes a function which returns bytes and an error, and wraps it as a http.HandlerFunc. If the error is nil, the bytes are written with Status OK. Else, the error is logged, and InternalServerError is returned as the response code. If you need to return a different response code (for example, StatusBadRequest), call wrapRespCode. SrvFunc is a function which takes URL parameters, and returns the requested data, and a response code. Note it does not take the full http.Request, and does not have the path. SrvFunc functions should be called via dispatch, and any additional data needed should be closed via a lambda. TODO split params and path into 2 separate wrappers? TODO change to simply take the http.Request? WrapParams takes a SrvFunc and wraps it as an http.HandlerFunc. Note if the SrvFunc returns 0 bytes, an InternalServerError is returned, and the response code is ignored, for security reasons. If an error response code is necessary, return bytes to that effect, for example, "Bad Request". DO NOT return informational messages regarding internal server errors; these should be logged, and only a 500 code returned to the client, for security reasons. prefix uas WrapUnpolledCheck wraps an http.HandlerFunc, returning ServiceUnavailable if all caches have't been polled; else, calling the wrapped func. Once all caches have been polled, we never return a 503 again, even if the CRConfig has been changed and new, unpolled caches exist. This is because, before those new caches existed in the CRConfig, they weren't being routed to, so it doesn't break anything to continue not routing to them until they're polled, while still serving polled caches as available. Whereas, on startup, if we were to return data with some caches unpolled, we would be telling clients that existing, potentially-available caches are unavailable, simply because we hadn't polled them yet. addTrailingEndpoints adds endpoints with trailing slashes to the given dispatch map. Without this, Go will match `route` and `route/` differently. encoding is case-insensitive, per the RFC gzipIfAccepts gzips the given bytes, writes a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the given writer, and returns the gzipped bytes, if the Request supports GZip (has an Accept-Encoding header). Else, returns the bytes unmodified. Note the given bytes are NOT written to the given writer. It is assumed the bytes may need to pass thru other middleware before being written. TODO this could be made more efficient by wrapping ResponseWriter with the GzipWriter, and letting callers writer directly to it - but then we'd have to deal with Closing the gzip.Writer./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/datareq/dsstat.go/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/datareq/dsstatfilter.goinDSescommaNamesparamNamesmaybeNameinvalid query parameter type '%v' - valid types are: {http, dns}"invalid query parameter type '%v' - valid types are: {http, dns}" DSStatFilter fulfills the cache.Filter interface, for filtering stats.

Available returns whether this delivery service is considered available by this stat. It is part of the StatCommonReadonly interface. CachesAvailable returns the number of caches available to the delivery service in this stat. It is part of the StatCommonReadonly interface. StatCacheStats is all the stats generated by a cache. This may also be used for aggregate stats, for example, the summary of all cache stats for a cache group, or delivery service. Each stat is an array, in case there are multiple data points at different times. However, a single data point i.e. a single array member is common. Sum adds the given cache stats to this cache stats. Numeric values are summed; strings are appended. Stat represents a complete delivery service stat, for a given poll, or at the time requested. ErrNotProcessedStat indicates a stat received is not used by Traffic Monitor, nor returned by any API endpoint. Receiving this error indicates the stat has been discarded. NewStat returns a new delivery service Stat, initializing pointer members. Copy performs a deep copy of this Stat. It does not modify, and is thus safe for multiple goroutines. TODO sync.Pool.

I don't think so. EvalCacheWithStatusInfo evaluates whether the given cache should be marked available, taking the server's configured Status into account as well as its polling information. EvalInterface returns whether the given interface should be marked available, a boolean of whether the result was over IPv4 (false means it was IPv6), a string describing why, and which stat exceeded a threshold. The `stats` may be nil, for pollers which don't poll stats. The availability of EvalCache MAY NOT be used to directly set the cache's local availability, because the threshold stats may not be part of the poller which produced the result. Rather, if the cache was previously unavailable from a threshold, it must be verified that threshold stat is in the results before setting the cache to available. The resultStats may be nil, and if so, won't be checked for thresholds. For example, the Health poller doesn't have Stats. TODO change to return a `cache.AvailableStatus` EvalAggregate calculates the availability of a cache server as an aggregate of server metrics and metrics of its network interfaces. return here first, even though EvalCacheWithStatus checks online, because we later assume that if EvalCacheWithStatus returns true, to return false if thresholds are exceeded; but, if the cache is ONLINE, we don't want to check thresholds. getProcessAvailableTuple gets a function to process an availability tuple based on the protocol used. CalcAvailability calculates the availability of each cache in results. statResultHistory may be nil, in which case stats won't be used to calculate availability. we know this cache was directly polled because otherwise we wouldn't have a cache.Result for it ExceedsThresholdMsg returns a human-readable message for why the given value exceeds the threshold. It does NOT check whether the value actually exceeds the threshold; call `InThreshold` to check first. for safety, if a threshold somehow gets corrupted, don't start marking caches down. calculateDeliveryServiceState calculates the state of delivery services from the new cache state data `cacheState` and the CRConfig data `deliveryServiceServers` and puts the calculated state in the outparam `deliveryServiceStates` NOTE: DisabledLocations is always empty, and it's important that it isn't nil, so it serialises to the JSON `[]` instead of `null`.

  StartHealthResultManager starts the goroutine which listens for health results. Note this polls the brief stat endpoint from ATS Astats, not the full stats. This poll should be quicker and less computationally expensive for ATS, but doesn't include all stat data needed for e.g. delivery service calculations.4 Returns the last health durations, events, the local cache statuses, and the health result history. This reads at least 1 value from the cacheHealthChan. Then, we loop, and try to read from the channel some more. If there's nothing to read, we hit `default` and process. If there is stuff to read, we read it, then inner-loop trying to read more. If we're continuously reading and the channel is never empty, and we hit the tick time, process anyway even though the channel isn't empty, to prevent never processing (starvation). processHealthResult processes the given health results, adding their stats to the CacheAvailableStatus. Note this is NOT threadsafe, because it non-atomically gets CacheAvailableStatuses, Events, LastHealthDurations and later updates them. This MUST NOT be called from multiple threads. create a copy, so the same data used for all processing of this cache health result health poller doesn't have statsappDatacacheHealthHandlercacheHealthPollercacheStatHandlercacheStatPollercachesChangedForHealthMgrcachesChangedForStatMgrcombineStateFuncdistributedPeerHandlerdistributedPeerPollerlastKbpsStatsmonitorConfigPolleropsConfigFilepeerHandlerpeerPollertrafficMonitorConfigFileNamecacheHealthTickonChangegithub.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_monitor/handler"github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_monitor/handler"NewTrafficOpsSessionThreadsafeNewCRStatesThreadsafeNewUintNewThreadsafeCachePollerConfigChannelTickChanGlobalContextsNewCacheMonitorConfigPollerSessionChannelOpsConfigChannelIntervalChanwriteConfigNewMonitorConfigResultChannelPeerPollerNewPeerNewCRStatesPeersThreadsafestarting ops config manager: %v"starting ops config manager: %v"starting monitor config file poller: %v"starting monitor config file poller: %v"monitor config file poll, polling file '%v': %v"monitor config file poll, polling file '%v': %v"monitor config file poll, loading bytes '%v' from '%v': %v"monitor config file poll, loading bytes '%v' from '%v': %v"monitor config file poll, getting log writers '%v': %v"monitor config file poll, getting log writers '%v': %v" Start starts the poller and handler goroutines this is the local state as discoverer by this traffic_monitor note this is the number of individual caches fetched from, not the number of times all the caches were polled. makes results chan passes results chan to poller each peer's last state is saved in this map healthTickListener listens for health ticks, and writes to the health iteration variable.

The initialRead parameter determines whether the given handler is called immediately with an attempted file read (without a signal). ipv6CIDRStrToAddr takes an IPv6 CIDR string, e.g. `2001:DB8::1/32` returns `2001:DB8::1`.

This includes everything needed for all calculations, such as Delivery Services. This is expensive, though, and may be hard on ATS, so it should poll less often. For a fast 'is it alive' poll, use the Health Result Manager poll. Returns the stat history, the duration between the stat poll for each cache, the last Kbps data, the calculated Delivery Service stats, and the unpolled caches list. The monitor can't run without a stat processor Note! bufferTimer MAY be uninitialized! If there is no cfg.StatBufferInterval, the timer WILL NOT be created with time.NewTimer(), and thus is NOT initialized, and MUST NOT have functions called, such as timer.Stop()! Those functions WILL panic. fake chan, if there is no stat buffer interval. Unused, if cfg.StatBufferInterval != nil. Buffer 1, so don't need a separate goroutine to write. if there is no stat buffer interval, make a timer which has already expired. resetBufferTimer resets the Buffer timer. It MUST have expired and been read. If the buffer loop is changed to allow finishing without being expired and read, this MUST be changed to stop and drain the channel (with a select/default, if it's possible to expire but not be read (like flush is now). Otherwise, it will deadlock and/or leak resources. resetFlushTimer resets the Flush timer. It may or may not have been read or expired. need to select/default because we don't know whether the flush timer was read There are 2 timers: the Buffer, and the Flush. The Buffer says "never process until this much time has elapsed" The Flush says "if we're continuously getting new stats, with no break, and this much time has elasped, go ahead and process anyway to prevent starvation" So, we continuously read from the stat channel, until Buffer has elasped. Even if the channel is empty, wait and keep trying to read. Then, we move to State 2: continuously read from the stat channel, while there are things to read. If at any point there's nothing more to read, then process. Otherwise, if there are always thing to read, then after Flush time has elapsed, then go ahead and read anyway, and go to State 1. Note that either the Buffer or Flush may be configured to be 0. If the Buffer is 0, we immediately move to phase 2: process as fast as we can, only flush to prevent starvation. This optimizes the Monitor for getting health as quickly as possible, at the cost of CPU. (Having a buffer itself puts CPU above getting health results quickly, and the buffer interval is a factor of that) If the Flush is 0, then the Monitor will process every Buffer interval, regardless whether results are still coming in. This attempts to optimize for stability, attempting to ensure a poll every (Buffer + Poll Time) interval. Note this attempt may fail, and in particular, if the Monitor is unable to keep up with the given poll time and buffer, it will continuously back up. For this reason, setting a Flush of 0 is not recommended. Note the Flush and Buffer times are cumulative. That is, the total "maximum time a cache can be unhealthy before we know" is the Poll+Flush+Buffer. So, the buffer time elapses, then we start a new flush interval. They don't run concurrently. flush loop - breaks after processing - processes when there are no pending results, or the flush time elapses. first, make sure the flushTimer hasn't expired, by itself (because GO selects aren't ordered, so it could starve if we were reading <-cacheStatChan at the same level flushTimer hadn't expired: read cacheStatChan at the same level now. This extra level is necessary, because Go selects aren't ordered, so even after the Flush timer expires, the "case" could still never get hit, if there were continuously results from <-cacheStatChan at the same level. we're still processing as much as possible, and flushing, don't break to the outer Buffer loop, until we process. Buffer expired (above), and the cacheStatChan is empty, so process no point doing anything, until we read at least one stat. If stat polling is disabled, this blocks forever buffer loop - never breaks - calls flushLoop to actually process, when the buffer time elapses. select only the bufferTimer first, to make sure it doesn't starve. buffer expired, move to State 2 (Flush) no point doing anything, until we read at least one stat. buffer time hadn't elapsed, so we know we aren't starving. Go ahead and read the stat chan + buffer now. TODO protect against bufferTimer starvation buffer expired, move to State 2 (Flush): process until there's nothing to process, or the Flush elapses. processStatResults processes the given results, creating and setting DSStats, LastStats, and other stats.

This could be made lock-free, if the performance was necessary TODO add separate locks for Caches and DeliveryService maps? NewCRStatesThreadsafe creates a new CRStatesThreadsafe object safe for multiple goroutine readers and a single writer. Get returns the internal Crstates object for reading. GetDeliveryServices returns the internal Crstates delivery services map for reading. GetCache returns the availability data of the given cache. This does not mutate, and is thus safe for multiple goroutines to call. GetCaches returns the availability data of all caches. This does not mutate, and is thus safe for multiple goroutines to call. GetDeliveryService returns the availability data of the given delivery service. This does not mutate, and is thus safe for multiple goroutines to call. SetCache sets the internal availability data for a particular cache. It does NOT set data if the cache doesn't already exist. By adding newly received caches with `AddCache`, this allows easily avoiding a race condition when an in-flight poller tries to set a cache which has been removed. AddCache adds the internal availability data for a particular cache. DeleteCache deletes the given cache from the internal data. SetDeliveryService sets the availability data for the given delivery service. DeleteDeliveryService deletes the given delivery service from the internal data. This MUST NOT be called by multiple goroutines. CRStatesPeersThreadsafe provides safe access for multiple goroutines to read a map of Traffic Monitor peers to their returned Crstates, with a single goroutine writer. NewCRStatesPeersThreadsafe creates a new CRStatesPeers object safe for multiple goroutine readers and a single writer. default to a large timeout GetCrstates returns the internal Traffic Monitor peer Crstates data. This MUST NOT be modified. GetPeerAvailability returns the state of the given peer GetCRStatesPeersInfo returns a CRStatesPeersInfo which contains a copy of some internal fields of this CRStatesPeersThreadsafe. This all happens within a single, locked read transaction so that all fields are in sync with each other. This is to avoid making multiple read copies within the same goroutine for the same operation, which is very inefficient. GetPeersOnline return a map of peers which are marked ONLINE in the latest CRConfig from Traffic Ops. This is NOT guaranteed to actually _contain_ all OFFLINE monitors returned by other functions, such as `GetPeerAvailability` and `GetQueryTimes`, but bool defaults to false, so the value of any key is guaranteed to be correct. GetQueryTimes returns the last query time of all peers numAvailablePeers is a private function to determine how many peers are currently available; callers must lock t Set sets the internal Traffic Monitor peer state and Crstates data. This MUST NOT be called by multiple goroutines. HasOptimisticQuorum returns true when the number of available peers is equal to or greater than the peer_optimistic_quorum_min setting. OptimisticQuorumEnabled returns true when peer_optimistic_quorum_min is set to a value greater than zero and the number of peers is greater than 1. Optimistic quorum requires a minimum of three Traffic Monitors; every individual monitor requires at least two peers to prevent a split-brain scenario that would be caused by having a single peer. If a single peer was legal (i.e.: two Traffic Monitors), neither peer would know which peer is reachable, and consequently both would serve 503s. This would force all Traffic Routers to use only their last-known state until the peering is restored, despite the fact that one of the two Traffic Monitors could still be reachable. A future enhancement could employ a heuristic to enable two monitors to determine whether they are offline independently by combining peer connectivity state with a calculation around the number of caches that are reachable, which might also include a rate of change in cache health state./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/peer/peer.go%s handler given error '%s'

Examples are HTTP, TCP, or NFS files. It only polls and returns bytes received, it does not do any parsing. For stat parsing, see traffic_monitor/cache/stats_types.go. PollerConfig is the data given to cache pollers when they're initialized. PollerGlobalInit performs global initialization, and returns a global context object. For example, a poller might create a threadsafe client object, which can be used concurrently by all pollers. PollerInit performs initialization for a specific poller. It takes the global context created by the poller's GlobalInit. For example, a poller might create a template client in its GlobalInit, and then use that to create a non-threadsafe client for each concurrent poller. pollers holds the functions for polling caches. This is not const, because Go doesn't allow constant maps. This is populated on startup, and MUST NOT be modified after startup. PollerFunc polls a cache. It takes the global context created by this Poller's GlobalInit, and the poller-specific context created by this poller's Init. It returns the response bytes, the time the request finished, the length of time the request took, and any error. If the PollerFunc needs the global context object, the Init func should embed it in the context object it returns. If Init is nil, the global context will be given to the poller. AddPollerType adds a poller with the given name, and the given init and poll funcs. The globalInit and init funcs may be nil; poller MUST NOT be nil.

"all caches polled, ready to serve!\n" UnpolledCaches is a structure containing a map of caches names (which have yet to be polled) to booleans (which, if true, means the cache is directly polled), which is threadsafe for multiple readers and one writer. This could be made lock-free, if the performance was necessary NewUnpolledCaches returns a new UnpolledCaches object. UnpolledCaches returns a map of caches not yet polled. Callers MUST NOT modify. If mutation is necessary, copy the map SetNewCaches takes a list of new caches, which may overlap with the existing caches, diffs them, removes any `unpolledCaches` which aren't in the new list, and sets the list of `polledCaches` (which is only used by this func) to the `newCaches`. Any returns whether there are any caches marked as not polled. Also returns true if SetNewCaches() has never been called (assuming there exist caches, if this hasn't been initialized, we couldn't have polled any of them). AnyDirectlyPolled returns whether there are any directly-polled caches marked as not polled. Also returns true if SetNewCaches() has never been called (assuming there exist caches, if this hasn't been initialized, we couldn't have polled any of them). SetPolled sets cache which have been polled. This is used to determine when the app has fully started up, and we can start serving. Serving Traffic Router with caches as 'down' which simply haven't been polled yet would be bad. Therefore, a cache is set as 'polled' if it has received different bandwidths from two different ATS ticks, OR if the cache is marked as down (and thus we won't get a bandwidth). This is threadsafe for one writer, along with `Set`. This is fast if there are no unpolled caches. Moreover, its speed is a function of the number of unpolled caches, not the number of caches total. TODO fix "whether a cache has ever been polled" to be generic somehow. The result.System.NotAvailable check is duplicated in health.EvalCache, and is fragile. What if another "successfully polled but unavailable" flag were added? SetHealthPolled sets caches which have been *health* polled (as opposed to *stat* polled). This is used, when stat polling is disabled, to determine when the app has fully started up, and we can start serving. Serving Traffic Router with caches as 'down' which simply haven't been polled yet would be bad. Therefore, a cache is set as 'polled' if it has given TM two results, OR if the cache is marked as down (and thus we don't need a 2nd result). if this cache has already been seen once before, consider it polled SetRemotePolled sets caches which have been *remote health* polled (as opposed to *locally health* polled)./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/threadsafe/resulthistory.go ResultHistory provides safe access for multiple goroutines readers and a single writer to a stored ResultHistory object.

ResultStatHistory provides safe access for multiple goroutines readers and a single writer to a stored HistoryHistory object. NewResultInfoHistory returns a new ResultInfoHistory safe for multiple readers and a single writer. Get returns the ResultInfoHistory. Callers MUST NOT modify. If mutation is necessary, call ResultInfoHistory.Copy() Set sets the internal ResultInfoHistory. This is only safe for one thread of execution. This MUST NOT be called from multiple threads. ResultStatHistory is a thread-safe mapping of cache server hostnames to CacheStatHistory objects containing statistics for those cache servers. map[string]CacheStatHistory NewResultStatHistory constructs a new, empty ResultStatHistory. LoadOrStore returns the stored CacheStatHistory for the given cache server hostname if it has already been stored. If it has not already been stored, a new, empty CacheStatHistory object is created, stored under the given hostname, and returned. TODO change to use sync.Pool? Range behaves like sync.Map.Range. It calls f for every value in the map; if f returns false, the iteration is stopped. interfaceStat is just a convenience structure used only for passing data about a single statistic for a network interface into compareAndAppendStatForInterface. compareAndAppendStatForInterface is a little helper function used to compare a single stat for a single network interface to its historical values and do the appropriate appending and management of the history to ensure it never exceeds `limit`. Add adds the given result to the stored statistics history, keeping only up to `limit` number of records for any given stat (oldest records will be removed to make way for new ones if the limit would otherwise be exceeded). If `limit` is zero, it will be treated as though it were one instead. If the new stat value is the same as the last, update the time and increment the span. Span is the number of polls the latest value has been the same, and hence the length of time it's been the same is span*pollInterval. ResultStatValHistory is thread-safe for one writer. Specifically, because a CompareAndSwap is not provided, it's not possible to Load and Store without a race condition. If multiple writers were necessary, it wouldn't be difficult to add a CompareAndSwap, internally storing an atomically-accessed pointer to the slice.  map[string][]ResultStatVal Load returns the []ResultStatVal for the given stat. If the given stat does not exist, nil is returned. Store stores the given []ResultStatVal in the ResultStatValHistory for the given stat. Store is thread-safe for only one writer. Specifically, if there are multiple writers, there's a race, that one writer could Load(), another writer could Store() underneath it, and the first writer would then Store() having lost values. To safely use ResultStatValHistory with multiple writers, a CompareAndSwap method would have to be added. CacheStatHistory is the type of a single record in a ResultStatHistory map. It contains interface statistics as well as historical statistics for each of a cache server's polled interfaces. Interfaces is a map of the names of network interfaces that have been polled for this cache server to historical collections of their polled Stats is a historical collection of all of the cache server's generic (non-interface-dependent) statistics. NewCacheStatHistory constructs a new empty CacheStatHistory. newStatEqual returns whether the given stat is equal to the latest stat in history. If len(history)==0, this returns false without error. If the given stat is not a JSON primitive (string, number, bool), this returns an error. We explicitly refuse to compare arrays and objects, for performance. if there's no history, it's "not equal", i.e. store this new history TODO in 1.0, stats are divided into 'location', 'cache', and 'type'. 'cache' are hidden by default. legacy reasons StatsMarshall encodes the stats in JSON, encoding up to historyCount of each stat. If statsToUse is empty, all stats are encoded; otherwise, only the given stats are encoded. If `wildcard` is true, stats which contain the text in each statsToUse are returned, instead of exact stat names. If cacheType is not CacheTypeInvalid, only stats for the given type are returned. If hosts is not empty, only the given hosts are returned.

ErrNilSession is the error returned by operations performed on a nil session. ByteTime is a structure for associating a set of raw data with some CDN Snapshot statistics, and a certain time. ByteMapCache is a thread-access-safe map of cache server hostnames to ByteTime structures. NewByteMapCache constructs a new, empty ByteMapCache. Set sets the entry given by 'key' to a new ByteTime structure with the given raw data ('newBytes') and the given statistics ('stats') at the current time. Get retrieves the raw data, associated time, and statistics of the entry given by 'key'. CRConfigStat represents a set of statistics from a CDN Snapshot requested at a particular time. Err contains any error that may have occurred when obtaining the ReqAddr is the network address from which the statistics were requested. ReqTime is the time at which the request for statistics was made. Stats contains the actual statistics. CopyCRConfigStat makes a deep copy of a slice of CRConfigStats. CRConfigHistoryThreadsafe stores history in a circular buffer. NewCRConfigHistoryThreadsafe constructs a new, empty CRConfigHistoryThreadsafe - this is the ONLY way to safely create a CRConfigHistoryThreadsafe, using the zero value of the structure will cause all operations to encounter segmentation faults, and there is no way to preempt this. 'limit' indicates the size of the circular buffer - effectively the number of entries it will be capable of storing. Add adds the given stat to the history. Does not add new additions with the same remote address and CRConfig Date as the previous. Get retrieves the stored history of CRConfigStat entries. Len gives the number of currently stored items in the buffer. An uninitialized buffer has zero length. TrafficOpsSessionThreadsafe provides access to the Traffic Ops client safe for multiple goroutines. This fulfills the ITrafficOpsSession interface. pointer-to-pointer, because we're given a pointer from the Traffic Ops package, and we don't want to copy it. NewTrafficOpsSessionThreadsafe returns a new threadsafe TrafficOpsSessionThreadsafe wrapping the given `Session`. Initialized tells whether or not the TrafficOpsSessionThreadsafe has been properly initialized with non-nil sessions. Update updates the TrafficOpsSessionThreadsafe's connection information with the provided information. It's safe for calling by multiple goroutines, being aware that they will race. always set unauthenticated sessions first which can eventually authenticate themselves when attempting requests setSession sets the session for the up-to-date client without logging in. setSession sets the session for the legacy client without logging in. getThreadsafeSession is used internally to get a copy of the session pointer, or nil if it doesn't exist. This should not be used outside TrafficOpsSessionThreadsafe, and never stored, because part of the purpose of rafficOpsSessionThreadsafe is to store a pointer to the Session pointer, so it can be updated by one goroutine and immediately used by another. This should only be called immediately before using the session, since someone else may update it concurrently. CRConfigHistory gets all of the stored, historical data about CRConfig Snapshots' Stats sections. CRConfigValid checks if the passed tc.CRConfig structure is valid, and ensures that it is from the same CDN as the last CRConfig Snapshot, as well as that it is newer than the last CRConfig Snapshot. Note this intentionally takes intended CDN, rather than trusting crc.Stats CRConfigRaw returns the CRConfig from the Traffic Ops. This is safe for LastCRConfig returns the last CRConfig requested from CRConfigRaw, and the time it was returned. This is designed to be used in conjunction with a poller which regularly calls CRConfigRaw. If no last CRConfig exists, because CRConfigRaw has never been called successfully, this calls CRConfigRaw once to try to get the CRConfig from Traffic Ops. trafficMonitorConfigMapRaw returns the Traffic Monitor config map from the Traffic Ops, directly from the monitoring endpoint. This is not usually what is needed, rather monitoring needs the snapshotted CRConfig data, which is filled in by `LegacyTrafficMonitorConfigMap`. This is safe for multiple goroutines. Default error case, no backup file exists TrafficMonitorConfigMap returns the Traffic Monitor config map from the Traffic Ops. This is safe for multiple goroutines. MonitorCDN returns the name of the CDN of a Traffic Monitor with the given hostName. nil-dereference checks done already in each 'fetch' method; they'll just return an error in that case/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/traffic_monitor.goInitAccessCfgstaticDatagithub.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_monitor/manager"github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_monitor/manager"No Git Revision Specified.

PGBackend is the Postgres implementation of TVBackend. String returns a high level overview of the backend and its keys. Name returns the name for this backend. ReadConfigFile takes in a filename and will read it into the backends config. Insert takes the current keys and inserts them into the backend DB. Start initiates the connection to the backend DB. ValidateKey validates that the keys are valid (in most cases, certain fields are not null). Close terminates the connection to the backend DB. Ping checks the connection to the backend DB. Fetch gets all of the keys from the backend DB. GetSSLKeys converts the backends internal key representation into the common representation (SSLKey). SetSSLKeys takes in keys and converts & encrypts the data into the backends internal format. GetDNSSecKeys converts the backends internal key representation into the common representation (DNSSecKey). SetDNSSecKeys takes in keys and converts & encrypts the data into the backends internal format. GetURISignKeys converts the pg internal key representation into the common representation (URISignKey). SetURISignKeys takes in keys and converts & encrypts the data into the backends internal format. GetURLSigKeys converts the backends internal key representation into the common representation (URLSigKey). SetURLSigKeys takes in keys and converts & encrypts the data into the backends internal format.

The functions here don't depend on any particular API version, so they need not be copy/pasted along with the entire testing suites. FindNeedle searches a "haystack" slice of values for the the "needle" value, returning true if the value is in the haystack, false otherwise. ErrorsToStrings converts a slice of errors to a slice of their error messages. Compare compares a set of expected alert messages to those actually received. It checks for the existence of each expected alert, not that they appear in any particular order. It also checks that no unexpected alert strings exist. Note that this isn't particularly efficient, which is fine because it's only meant to be used in testing.

V5TestCase is a map of test names to maps of HTTP request method descriptions to V5TestData structures. CkReqFunc defines the reusable signature for all other functions that perform checks. Common parameters that are checked include the request's info, response, alerts, and errors. CkRequest wraps CkReqFunc functions, to be concise and reduce lexical tokens i.e. Instead of `[]CkReqFunc {` we can use `CkRequest(` in test case declarations. NoError checks that no error was returned (i.e. `nil`). HasError checks that an error was returned (i.e. not `nil`). HasStatus checks that the status code from the request is as expected. HasAlertLevel checks that the alert from the request matches the expected level. ResponseHasLength checks that the length of the response is as expected. Determines that response is a slice before checking the length of the reflected value. ResponseLengthGreaterOrEqual checks that the response is greater or equal to the expected length./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/toclientlib/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/toclientlib/endpoints.goCacheHitStatusExpiredCacheHitStatusHitCacheHitStatusInvalidDefaultAPIVersionCheckIntervalErrIsNotImplementedErrNotImplementedHTTPErrorLoginWithCertLoginWithTokenMidReqFNewClientNewNoAuthClientReqFStringToCacheHitStatusapiBaseStrcomposeReqFuncsloginCredsloginTokenmakeRequestWithHeaderreqAPIreqFallbackreqLoginreqTryLatest/api/"/api/" APIBase returns the base API string for HTTP requests, such as /api/3.1. APIVersion is the version of the Traffic Ops API this client will use for requests. If the client was created with any function except Login, or with UseLatestSupportedAPI false, this will be LatestAPIVersion(). Otherwise, it will be the version dynamically determined to be the latest the Traffic Ops Server supports.

Login authenticates with Traffic Ops and returns the client object. Returns the logged in client, the remote address of Traffic Ops which was translated and used to log in, and any error. If the error is not nil, the remote address may or may not be nil, depending whether the error occurred before the login request. apiVersions is the list of API versions to be supported. This should generally be provided by the specific client version wrapping this library. See ClientOpts for details about options, which options are required, and how they behave. ClientOpts is the options to configure the creation of the Client. This exists to allow adding new features without a breaking change to the Login function. Users should understand this, and understand that upgrading their library may result in new options that their application doesn't know to use. New fields should always behave as-before if their value is the default. ForceLatestAPI will cause Login to return an error if the latest minor API in the client is not supported by the Traffic Ops Server. Note this was the behavior of all Traffic Ops client functions prior to the Login function. If this is false or unset, login will determine the latest minor version supported, and use that for all requests. Be aware, this means client fields unknown to the server will always be default-initialized. For example, suppose the field Foo was added in API 3.1, the client code is 3.1, and the server is 3.0. Then, the field Foo will always be nil or the default value. Client applications must understand this, and code processing the new feature Foo must be able to process default or nil values, understanding they may indicate a server version before the feature was added. Insecure is whether to ignore HTTPS certificate errors with Traffic Ops. Setting this on production systems is strongly discouraged. RequestTimeout is the HTTP timeout for Traffic Ops requests. If 0 or not explicitly set, DefaultTimeout will be used. UserAgent is the HTTP User Agent to use set when communicating with Traffic Ops. This field is required, and Login will fail if it is unset or the empty string. APIVersionCheckInterval is how often to try a newer Traffic Ops API Version. This allows clients to get new Traffic Ops features after Traffic Ops is upgraded without requiring a restart or new client. If 0 or not explicitly set, DefaultAPIVersionCheckInterval will be used. To disable, set to a very high value (like 100 years). This has no effect if ForceLatestAPI is true. TOClient is a Traffic Ops client, with generic functions to be used by any specific client. forceLatestAPI is whether to forcibly always use the latest API version known to this client. This should only ever be set by ClientOpts.ForceLatestAPI. lastAPIVerCheck is the last time the Client tried to get a newer API version from TO. Used internally to decide whether to try again. apiVerCheckInterval is how often to try a newer Traffic Ops API, in case Traffic Ops was upgraded. This should only ever be set by ClientOpts.APIVersionCheckInterval. apiVersions is the list of support Traffic Ops versions. This must be provided on construction, typically by the client wrapping this lib. NewClient returns a reference to a TOClient instance with the given settings. This instance is not authenticated with Traffic Ops; external callers should generally use Login, LoginWithToken, or LoginWithAgent instead. DefaultTimeout is the default amount of time a TOClient instance will wait for a response to its requests before giving up. DefaultAPIVersionCheckInterval is the default minimum amount of time a TOClient will wait between checking for a newer API version from Traffic Ops. HTTPError is returned on Update Client failure. Error implements the error interface for our customer error type. loginCreds gathers login credentials for Traffic Ops. loginToken gathers token login credentials for Traffic Ops. login tries to log in to Traffic Ops, and set the auth cookie in the Client. Returns the IP address of the remote Traffic Ops. Can't use req() because it retries login failures, which would be an infinite loop. logout of Traffic Ops. LoginWithCert returns an authenticated TOClient. Start with	toURL := "https://trafficops.example"	apiVers := []string{"3.0", "3.1"}	to := LoginWithClient(toURL, true, "certfile", "keyFile", "myapp/1.0", DefaultTimeout, apiVers) subsequent calls like to.GetData("datadeliveryservice") will be authenticated. Returns the logged in client, the remote IP address of Traffic Ops to which the given URL was resolved and used to authenticate, and any error that occurred. If the error is not nil, the remote address may or may not be nil, depending on whether the error occurred before the login request. apiVersions is the list of API versions supported in this client. This should generally be provided by the client package wrapping this package. LoginWithAgent returns an authenticated TOClient.	to := LoginWithAgent(toURL, "user", "passwd", true, "myapp/1.0", DefaultTimeout, apiVers) depending whether the error occurred before the login request. LoginWithToken returns an authenticated TOClient, using a token for said	to := LoginWithToken(toURL, "token", true, "myapp/1.0", DefaultTimeout, apiVers) LogoutWithAgent creates a new TOClient, authenticates that client with Traffic Ops, then immediately logs out before returning the TOClient. As a result, the returned TOClient is *not* authenticated, but it is verified that authentication can be performed with the given information. NewNoAuthClient returns a new Client without logging in this can be used for querying unauthenticated endpoints without requiring a login The apiVersions is the list of API versions supported in this client. This should generally be provided by the client package wrapping this package. Close closes all idle "kept-alive" connections in the client's connection pool. Note that connections in use are unaffected by this call, so it's not necessarily true that calling this method will leave the client with no open connections. This will always return a nil error, the signature is just meant to conform to io.Closer. ErrIsNotImplemented checks that the given error stems from ErrNotImplemented. Caution: This method does not unwrap errors, and relies on the common behavior of concatenating error messages in cascading errors to detect the inheritance. use string.Contains in case context was added to the error ErrNotImplemented is returned when Traffic Ops returns a 501 Not Implemented Users should check ErrIsNotImplemented rather than comparing directly, in case context was added. errorFromStatusCode returns an error if and when the response status code of `resp` warrants it. Specifically, it checks that the response code is either in the < 300 range, but with a special exception for Not Modified. The error given is any network-level error that might have occurred, which is used in lieu of an HTTP-based error being unavailable. Path is the request path, used for informational purposes in the error message text. getURL constructs a full URL from the given path, relative to the TOClient's URL. A ReqF is a function that can produce a ReqInf and any occurring error from a TOClient, a request method and path, an optional request bod, an HTTP header, and optionally decode the response into a provided reference. A MidReqF is a middleware that operates on a ReqF to return a ReqF with some additional behavior added. composeReqFuncs takes an initial request func and middleware, and returns a single ReqFunc to be called. compose in reverse-order, which causes them to be applied in forward-order. reqTryLatest will re-set to.latestSupportedAPI to the latest, if it's less than the latest and to.apiVerCheckInterval has passed. This does not fallback, so it should generally be composed with reqFallback. Client could have been default-initialized rather than created with a func, so we need to check here, not just in login funcs. if it's been apiVerCheckInterval since the last version check, set the version to the latest (and fall back again, if necessary) Set the last version check to far in the future, and then defer setting the last check until this function returns, so that if fallback takes longer than the interval, the recursive calls to this function don't end up forever retrying the latest. reqLogin makes the request, and if it fails, tries to log in again then makes the request again. If the login fails, the original response is returned. If the second request fails, it's returned. Login is only tried once. This is designed to handle expired sessions, when the time between requests is longer than the session expiration; it does not do perpetual retry. reqFallback calls reqF, and if Traffic Ops doesn't support the latest version, falls back to the previous and retries, recursively. If all supported versions fail, the last response error is returned. we're already on the oldest minor supported, and the server doesn't support it. reqAPI calls reqF with a path not including the /api/x prefix, and adds the API version from the Client. For example, path should be like '/deliveryservices' and this will request '/api/3.1/deliveryservices'. makeRequestWithHeader marshals the response body (if non-nil), performs the HTTP request, and decodes the response into the given response pointer. Note processing on the following codes: 304 http.StatusNotModified  - Will return the 304 in ReqInf, a nil error, and a nil response. 401 http.StatusUnauthorized - Via to.request(), Same as 403 Forbidden. 403 http.StatusForbidden    - Via to.request()	Will try to log in again, and try the request again.	The second request is returned, even if it fails. To request the bytes without deserializing, pass a *[]byte response. Don't bother checking for alerts if there's no error; we wouldn't do anything with them in that case anyway ignore errors; some responses may not be regularly-formed, and if it's a problem later steps will uncover it. Req makes a request using the given HTTP request method, request path (which should include any needed query string), optionally a request body, any additional HTTP headers to send, and optionally a reference into which to place a decoded response. request performs the HTTP request to Traffic Ops, trying to refresh the cookie if an Unauthorized or Forbidden code is received. It only tries once. If the login fails, the original Unauthorized/Forbidden response is returned. If the login succeeds and the subsequent re-request fails, the re-request's response is returned even if it's another Unauthorized/Forbidden. Returns the response, the remote address of the Traffic Ops instance used, and any error. The returned net.Addr is guaranteed to be either nil or valid, even if the returned error is not nil. Callers are encouraged to check and use the net.Addr if an error is returned, and use the remote address in their own error messages. This violates the Go idiom that a non-nil error implies all other values are undefined, but it's more straightforward than alternatives like typecasting. if re-logging-in fails, return the original request's response return second request, even if it's another Unauthorized or Forbidden. RawRequestWithHdr makes an HTTP request to Traffic Ops. This differs from the Req method in a few ways: it returns a reference to an http.Response instead of doing any decoding for the caller, it does not do any automatic encoding of request bodies for the caller, and it includes no middleware, meaning that authentication is not retried and API version fallback is not done. RawRequest performs the actual HTTP request to Traffic Ops, simply, without trying to refresh the cookie if an Unauthorized code is returned. Returns the response, the remote address of the Traffic Ops instance used, and any error. The returned net.Addr is guaranteed to be either nil or valid, even if the returned error is not nil. Callers are encouraged to check and use the net.Addr if an error is returned, and use the remote address in their own error messages. This violates the Go idiom that a non-nil error implies all other values are undefined, but it's more straightforward than alternatives like typecasting.

NilTransactionError is returned by Info methods when the transaction internally referred to by the Info cannot be found. ResourceModifiedError is a user-safe error that indicates a precondition failure. Common context.Context value keys. GoneHandler is an http.Handler function that just writes a 410 Gone response back to the client, along with an error-level alert stating that the endpoint is no longer available. WriteAndLogErr writes the response and logs a warning if an error occurs. This should be used in favor of simply calling w.Write() so that errors are properly logged for troubleshooting. WriteResp takes any object, serializes it as JSON, and writes that to w. Any errors are logged and written to w as alerts (if applicable). This is a helper for the common case; not using this in unusual cases is perfectly acceptable. WriteRespRaw acts like WriteResp, but doesn't wrap the object in a `{"response":` object. This should be used to respond with endpoints which don't wrap their response in a "response" object. WriteRespWithSummary writes a JSON-encoded representation of an arbitrary object to the provided writer, and cleans up the corresponding request object. It also provides a "summary" section to the response object that contains the given "count". WriteRespVals is like WriteResp, but also takes a map of root-level values to write. The API most commonly needs these for meta-parameters, like size, limit, and orderby. This is a helper for the common case; not using this in unusual cases is perfectly acceptable. WriteIMSHitResp writes a response to 'w' for an IMS request "hit", using the passed time as the Last-Modified date. HandleErr handles an API error, rolling back the transaction, writing the given statusCode and userErr to the user, and logging the sysErr. If userErr is nil, the text of the HTTP statusCode is written. The tx may be nil, if there is no transaction. Passing a nil tx is strongly discouraged if a transaction exists, because it will result in copy-paste errors for the common Info use case. Don't return, attempt to rollback and write the error anyway HandleDeprecatedErr handles an API error, adding a deprecation alert, rolling back the transaction, writing the given statusCode and userErr to the user, and logging the sysErr. If userErr is nil, the text of the HTTP statusCode is written. The alternative may be nil if there is no alternative and the deprecation message will be selected appropriately. LogErr handles the logging of errors and setting up possibly nil errors without actually writing anything to a http.ResponseWriter, unlike handleSimpleErr. It returns the userErr which will be initialized to the http.StatusText of errCode if it was passed as nil - otherwise left alone. handleSimpleErr is a helper for HandleErr. This exists to prevent exposing HandleErr calls in this file with nil transactions, which might be copy-pasted creating bugs. RespWriter is a helper to allow a one-line response, for endpoints with a function that returns the object that needs to be written and an error. RespWriterVals is like RespWriter, but also takes a map of root-level values to write. The API most commonly needs these for meta-parameters, like size, limit, and orderby. WriteRespAlert creates an alert, serializes it as JSON, and writes that to w. WriteRespAlertNotFound creates an alert indicating that the resource was not found and writes that to w. WriteRespAlertObj Writes the given alert, and the given response object. IntParams parses integer parameters, and returns map of the given params, or an error if any integer param is not an integer. The intParams may be nil if no integer parameters are required. Note this does not check existence; if an integer paramter is required, it should be included in the requiredParams given to NewInfo. ParamsHaveRequired checks that params have all the required parameters, and returns nil on success, or an error providing information on which params are missing. StripParamJSON removes ".json" trailing any parameter value, and returns the modified params. This allows the API handlers to transparently accept /id.json routes, as allowed by the 1.x API. AllParams takes the request (in which the router has inserted context for path parameters), and an array of parameters required to be integers, and returns the map of combined parameters, and the map of int parameters; or a user or system error and the HTTP error code. The intParams may be nil if no integer parameters are required. ParseValidator objects can make use of api.Parse to handle parsing and validating at the same time. TODO: Rework validation to be able to return system-level errors Parse decodes a JSON object from r into v, validating and sanitizing the input. Use this function instead of the json package when writing API endpoints to safely decode and validate PUT and POST requests. TODO: change to take data loaded from db, to remove sql from tc package. WriteNotModifiedResponse writes a 304 Not Modified response with the given last modification time to the provided response writer. The request must be provided as well, so that it can be marked as handled. SendMail sends an email msg to the address identified by to. The msg parameter should be an RFC822-style email with headers first, a blank line, and then the message body. The lines of msg should be CRLF terminated. The msg headers should usually include fields such as "From", "To", "Subject", and "Cc". Sending "Bcc" messages is accomplished by including an email address in the to parameter but not including it in the msg headers. The cfg parameter is used to set things like the "From" field, as well as for connection and authentication with an external SMTP server. SendMail returns (in order) an HTTP status code, a user-friendly error, and an error fit for logging to system error logs. If either the user or system error is non-nil, the operation failed, and the HTTP status code indicates the type of failure. Version represents an API version. GetRequestedAPIVersion returns a pointer to the requested API Version from the request if it exists or returns nil otherwise. path doesn't start with `/api`, so it's not an api request path starts with `/api` but not `/api/{version}`, so it's an api request, and an unknown/nonexistent version. GetDB returns the database from the context. This should very rarely be needed, rather `NewInfo` should always be used to get a transaction, except in extenuating circumstances. this return should never be reached because a non-nil TrafficVault should always be included in the request context setRespWritten sets the APIRespWrittenKey key in the Context of the given Request. This is used to indicate that a response has been written with an API helper, and to prevent double-write errors. If an API helper which responds is called after another response helper was already called, all API helpers will log an error, and not write the second response, except HandleErr, which will write its error anyway, along with its status code. respWritten gets the APIRespWrittenKey key, which indicates whether an API response helper was previously called. This is used to prevent double-write errors. See setRespWritten. small helper function to help with parsing below parses pq errors for any trigger based conflicts parses pq errors for not null constraint parses pq errors for empty string check constraint parses pq errors for violated foreign key constraints parses pq errors for uniqueness constraint violations parses pq errors for database enum constraint violations parses pq errors for ON DELETE RESTRICT fk constraint violations Note: This method would also catch an ON UPDATE RESTRICT fk constraint, but only an error message appropriate for delete is returned. Currently, no API endpoint can trigger an ON UPDATE RESTRICT fk constraint since no API endpoint updates the primary key of any table. ATM I'm not sure if there is significance in restricting either of the table names that are captured in the regex to not contain any underscores. This function fixes issues like #3410. If an error message needs to be made for tables with underscores in particular, it should be made into an issue and this function should be updated then. At the moment, there are no documented issues for this case, so I won't include it. It may be helpful to look at constraints for api_capability, role_capability, and user_role for examples. small heuristic for grammar ParseDBError parses pq errors for database constraint violations, and returns the (userErr, sysErr, httpCode) format expected by the API helpers. GetUserFromReq returns the current user, any user error, any system error, and an error code to be returned if either error was not nil. This also uses the given ResponseWriter to refresh the cookie, if it was valid. SendEmailFromTemplate allows a user to input an html template to format an email.  It parses the template and creates a message before calling the SendMail method. SendEmailFromTemplate returns (in order) an HTTP status code, a user-friendly error, and an error fit for CreateDeprecationAlerts creates a deprecation notice with an optional alternative route suggestion. CheckIfUnModified checks to see if the resource was modified since the "If-Unmodified-Since" header value in the request. In case it was, the 412 error code is returned. If some other error was encountered while checking, the appropriate error code along with error details is returned. If the resource was not modified since the specified time, the UPDATE proceeds in the normal fashion. CheckIfUnModifiedByName checks to see if the resource was modified since the "If-Unmodified-Since" header value in the request. GetLastUpdated checks for the resource by ID in the database, and returns its last_updated timestamp, if available. GetLastUpdatedByName checks for the resource by name in the database, and returns its last_updated timestamp, if available. IsUnmodified returns a boolean, saying whether or not the resource in question was modified since the time specified in the headers. no IUS/IM header: unmodified, proceed with normal update FormatLastModified trims the time string and formats it according to RFC1123. AddLastModifiedHdr adds the "last modified" header to the response.

If no error has occurred, this *should* be http.StatusOK. systemError is an error that occurred internally; not safe for exposure to the user. userError is an error that should be shown to the user to explain why their request failed. Code returns the HTTP response code. If no error has occurred, this *should* return http.StatusOK. SetCode sets the HTTP response code returned by `Code`. SystemError returns an error that occurred internally; not safe for exposure to the user. UserError returns an error that should be shown to the user to explain why their request failed. This **must** return `nil` whenever `Code` returns a value above 499. SetSystemErrorString sets the Errs' system-level error to a new error containing the passed message. SetSystemError sets the Errs' system-level error to the passed error. SetSystemErrorf sets the Errs' system-level error to a new error containing the passed formatted message, in the fmt package's syntax (allows wrapping via %w). SetUserError sets the Errs' user-level error to the passed error. SetUserErrorString sets the Errs' user-level error to a new error containing the passed message. SetUserErrorf sets the Errs' user-level error to a new error containing the passed formatted message, in the fmt package's syntax (allows wrapping via %w). Error implements the error interface. This will return the user error, if there is one, otherwise it will return the system error. In the case that no actual error has occurred, it will neturn an empty string. This panics if the Errs it is called on is nil (just like a normal error would). Errors represents a set of zero to two errors to be handled by the API. SetCode sets the HTTP response code returned by `Code`. In general, you probably won't need to use this. SetSystemErrorString sets the Errors' system-level error to the passed error. In general, you probably won't need to use this. SetSystemErrorf sets the Errors' system-level error to a new error containing the passed formatted message, in the fmt package's syntax (allows wrapping via %w).

In the case that no actual error has occurred, it will neturn an empty string. This panics if the Errors it is called on is nil (just like a normal error would). NewErrors directly constructs a new Errors using the passed information. NewSystemError creates an Errors that only contains the given system error, and has the appropriate response code. NewSystemErrorString creates an Errors that only contains a system error, having the appropriate response code and containing the given message. NewSystemErrorf creates an Errors that only contains a system error, having the appropriate response code, and containing a message from the given format arguments (using the fmt package's syntax, with %w allowed for wrapping). NewUserError creates an Errors that only contains the given user error, NewUserErrorString creates an Errors that only contains a user error, NewUserErrorf creates an Errors that only contains a user error, having NewResourceModifiedError creates an Errors that only contains an HTTP Precondition Failed status code and associated error message./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api/generic_crud.goorderBypaginationwheredontRunSecondimsDateimsDateHeaderqueryValuesrunSecondmaxTimeuseIMSdbhelpersgithub.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/util/ims"github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/util/ims"github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/dbhelpers"github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/dbhelpers" create scanning: " create scanning: " create: no " create: no " was inserted, no id was returned" was inserted, no id was returned"too many ids returned from "too many ids returned from " insert" insert""serviceCategory" was inserted, no row was returned" was inserted, no row was returned"too many rows returned from "too many rows returned from "IMS request header date '%s' not parsable"IMS request header date '%s' not parsable"Couldn't get the max last updated time: %v"Couldn't get the max last updated time: %v"LatestTimestampLatestTimejson:"latestTime" db:"max"Failed to parse the max time stamp into a struct %v"Failed to parse the max time stamp into a struct %v"BuildWhereAndOrderByAndPaginationIMS HIT"IMS HIT"IMS MISS"IMS MISS"Non IMS request"Non IMS request"querying "querying "scanning "scanning "scanning lastUpdated from "scanning lastUpdated from " insert: " insert: " update affected too many rows: >1" update affected too many rows: >1"deleting "deleting ": getting rows affected: ": getting rows affected: " with that key found" with that key found" delete affected too many rows: %d" delete affected too many rows: %d" GenericOptionsDeleter can use any key listed in DeleteKeyOptions() to delete a resource.

TryIfModifiedSinceQuery checks to see the max time that an entity was changed, and then returns a boolean (which tells us whether or not to run the main query for the endpoint) along with the max time If the returned boolean is false, there is no need to run the main query for the GET API endpoint, and we return a 304 status ToDo: Remove orderBy, pagination from all the implementations, and eventually remove it from the function definition This should only ever contain one row The request IMS time is later than the max of (lastUpdated, deleted_time) Case where we need to run the second query GenericUpdate handles the common update case, where the update returns the new last_modified time.

It also provides some methods for accomplishing common tasks. Params is a mapping of all query string and path parameters to their respective values. The behavior of this map is not defined when any two query string parameters and/or path parameters share a name. For example, if the route is `cdns/{id}/delivery_services/{id}`, the two cannot be distinguished. Similarly, a request like `GET /api/5.0/cdns?id=1&id=2` will give either an "id" key that maps to "1", or an "id" key that maps to "2". Most convolutedly, for the aforementioned route definition, the request `GET cdns/1/deliveryservices/2?id=3&id=4` gives four possible values for the "id" key. Take care when constructing routes and deciding the parameters they will accept. IntParams is a mapping of all of the declared parameters that are to be parsed as ints to the parsed values of those parameters. No key will appear here that isn't also in Params. The currently authenticated user - this may be `nil` on routes that do not require authentication. A unique identifier for the request. The version of the API being requested. This is a pointer for legacy reasons - all handlers should assume this is not nil (with the possible exception of plugin handlers). A transaction opened to the Traffic Ops database. The cancel function for the request and transaction contexts. The Traffic Vault implementation. Config is the Traffic Ops server's current configuration. This is a pointer presumably to save memory; it should and must never be `nil`. NewInfo get and returns the context info needed by handlers. It also returns any user error, any system error, and the status code which should be returned to the client if an error occurred. It is encouraged to call Info.Tx.Tx.Commit() manually when all queries are finished, to release database resources early, and also to return an error to the user if the commit failed. In practice, though, the `Close` method handles this in nearly every case. NewInfo guarantees the returned Info.Tx is non-`nil` and Info.Tx.Tx is `nil` or valid, even if a returned error is not `nil`. Hence, it is safe to pass the Tx.Tx to HandleErr when this returns errors. Close() must be called to free resources, and should be called in a defer immediately after NewInfo(), to finish the transaction. Example:	func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {	  inf, userErr, sysErr, errCode := api.NewInfo(r, nil, nil)	  if userErr != nil || sysErr != nil {	    api.HandleErr(w, r, inf.Tx.Tx, errCode, userErr, sysErr)	    return	  }	  defer inf.Close()	  respObj, err := finalDatabaseOperation(inf.Tx)	  if err != nil {	    api.HandleErr(w, r, inf.Tx.Tx, http.StatusInternalServerError, nil, fmt.Errorf("final db op: %w", err))	  if err := inf.Tx.Tx.Commit(); err != nil {	    api.HandleErr(w, r, inf.Tx.Tx, http.StatusInternalServerError, nil, fmt.Errorf("committing transaction: %w", err))	  api.WriteResp(w, r, respObj) only place we could call cancel here is in Info.Close(), which already will rollback the transaction (which is all cancel will do.) must be last, MUST not return an error if this succeeds, without closing the tx CheckPrecondition checks a request's "preconditions" - its If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers versus the last updated time of the requested object(s), and returns (in order), an HTTP response code appropriate for the precondition check results, a user-safe error that should be returned to clients, and a server-side error that should be logged. Callers must pass in a query that will return one row containing one column that is the representative date/time of the last update of the requested object(s), and optionally any values for placeholder arguments in the query. Close implements the io.Closer interface. It should be called in a defer immediately after NewInfo(). Close will commit the transaction, if it hasn't been rolled back. WriteOKResponse writes a 200 OK response with the given object as the 'response' property of the response body. This CANNOT be used by any Info that wasn't constructed for the caller by Wrap - ing a Handler (yet). WriteOKResponseWithSummary writes a 200 OK response with the given object as the 'response' property of the response body, and the given count as the `count` property of the response's summary. Deprecated: Summary sections on responses were intended to cover up for a deficiency in jQuery-based tables on the front-end, so now that we aren't using those anymore it serves no purpose. time as the last modified time in the headers. WriteSuccessResponse writes the given response object as the `response` property of the response body, with the accompanying message as a success-level Alert. WriteCreatedResponse writes the given response object as the `response` property of the response body of a 201 created response, with the accompanying message as a success-level Alert. It also sets the Location header to the given path. This will be automatically prefaced with the correct path to the API version the client requested. RequestHeaders returns the headers sent by the client in the API request. SetLastModified sets the "last modified" header on the response writer. DecodeBody reads the client request's body and attempts to decode it into the provided reference. SendMail is a convenience method used to call SendMail using an Info structure's configuration. IsResourceAuthorizedToCurrentUser is a convenience method used to call github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/tenant.IsResourceAuthorizedToUserTx using an Info structure to provide the current user and database transaction. CreateChangeLog creates a new changelog message at the APICHANGE level for the current user. UseIMS returns whether or not If-Modified-Since constraints should be used to service the given request. CreateInfluxClient constructs and returns an InfluxDB HTTP client, if enabled and when possible. The error this returns should not be exposed to the user; it's for logging purposes only. If Influx connections are not enabled, this will return `nil` - but also no error. It is expected that the caller will handle this situation appropriately. this is the only one that's optional DefaultSort sets the `orderby` query string parameter to the given value, as though the client had set it, should it be missing./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api/shared_handlers.gocombinedParamsoptionsDeleterinterfacePtrobjectTypeerrHandlersuccessHandlerparamKeykfauthorizedalertsObjhasAlertskeyFieldsupdaterdeleterisOptionsDeleterobjElemobjElemIntobjSliceresponseObjdepAlertssingleCreatorsliceOfTcreatorSlicedesiredTypegenericInta wrapped handler was called without an API version"a wrapped handler was called without an API version"path parameters found with bad type: %T"path parameters found with bad type: %T"no PathParams found in Context"no PathParams found in Context"cannot parse to integer"cannot parse to integer"cannot parse to boolean"cannot parse to boolean"no path parameters: %s"no path parameters: %s"Refusing to delete all resources of type "Refusing to delete all resources of type "reflect: can only indirect from a pointer"reflect: can only indirect from a pointer"Couldnt get the config %v"Couldnt get the config %v"missing key: "missing key: "failed to parse key: "failed to parse key: "unable to parse required keys from request body"unable to parse required keys from request body"checking tenant authorized: "checking tenant authorized: "not authorized on this tenant"not authorized on this tenant"inserting changelog: %w"inserting changelog: %w" was updated." was updated."Perform a CDN snapshot then queue updates on all servers in the cdn for the changes to take effect."Perform a CDN snapshot then queue updates on all servers in the cdn for the changes to take effect."changelog for delete on object"changelog for delete on object"inserting changelog: "inserting changelog: " was deleted." was deleted."no request body supplied"no request body supplied"No objects were provided in request."No objects were provided in request." was created." was created."s were created."s were created."SliceOfwe take the first value and do not support multiple keys in query parameterspath parameters will overwrite query parameters decodeAndValidateRequestBody decodes and validates a pointer to a struct implementing the Validator interface SetLastModifiedHeader sets the Last-Modified header in case the "useIMS" is set to true in the config, and if there is an "If-Modified-Since" header in the incoming request ReadHandler creates a handler function from the pointer to a struct implementing the Reader interface	this handler retrieves the user from the context	combines the path and query parameters	produces the proper status code based on the error code returned	marshals the structs returned into the proper response json DeprecatedReadHandler creates a net/http.HandlerFunc for the passed Reader object, and adds a deprecation notice, optionally with a passed alternative route suggestion. readHandlerHelper takes a Reader, errWriterFunc, and readSuccessWriterFunc as input and returns a basic http.HandlerFunc for Reader types. By taking an errWriterFunc and readSuccessWriterFunc as input, this function allows callers to provide their own variations of error handling and success handling. For instance, ReadHandler and DeprecatedReadHandler should be exactly the same, except that DeprecatedReadHandler always returns a deprecation alert in its response, whereas ReadHandler does not. UpdateHandler creates a handler function from the pointer to a struct implementing the Updater interface	this generic handler encapsulates the logic for handling:	*fetching the id from the path parameter	*current user	*decoding and validating the struct	*change log entry	*forming and writing the body over the wireexpecting a slice of the key fields info which is a struct with the field name and a function to convert a string into a {}interface of the right type. in most that will be [{Field:"id",Func: func(s string)({}interface,error){return strconv.Atoi(s)}}] ignoring ok value -- will be checked after param processing a map of keyField to keyValue where keyValue is an {}interface if key's value provided in params,  overwrite it and ignore that provided in JSON check that all keys were properly filled in if the object has tenancy enabled, check that user is able to access the tenant DeleteHandler creates a handler function from the pointer to a struct implementing the Deleter interface DeprecatedDeleteHandler creates a handler function from the pointer to a struct implementing the Deleter interface with a optional deprecation notice deleteHandlerHelper takes a Deleter, errWriterFunc, and deleteSuccessWriterFunc as input and returns a basic http.HandlerFunc for Deleter types. By taking an errWriterFunc and deleteSuccessWriterFunc as input, this function allows callers to provide their own variations of error handling and success handling. For instance, DeleteHandler and DeprecatedDeleteHandler should be exactly the same, except that DeprecatedDeleteHandler always returns a deprecation alert in its response, whereas DeleteHandler does not. expecting a slice of the key fields info which is a struct with the field name and a function to convert a string into a interface{} of the right type. in most that will be [{Field:"id",Func: func(s string)(interface{},error){return strconv.Atoi(s)}}] if the type assertion of a key fails it will be should be set to the zero value of the type and the delete should fail (this means the code is not written properly no changes of user input should cause this.) CreateHandler creates a handler function from the pointer to a struct implementing the Creator interface DeprecatedCreateHandler creates a net/http.HandlerFunc for the passed Creator object, and adds a deprecation A Handler is an API endpoint handlers. They take in Info helper objects and return - in order - an HTTP response status code, a user-facing error (if one occurred), and a system-only error not safe for exposure to clients (if one occurred). Wrap wraps an API endpoint handler in the more generic HTTP request handler type from the http package. This constructs and provides the Info for the underlying Handler. If the handler requires any request path and/or query string parameters, those should be declared in requiredParams. Likewise, if any of those parameters are required to be integral, they should be named in intParams. Note that this will still require the normal routing middleware for authentication and context setup. Also note that handlers utilizing this need not defer closing of the provided Info, as this will handle that for them. Finally, make sure this is ONLY used on versioned endpoints; this will return an internal error if there is no associated API version./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api/shared_interfaces.go GetAlerts retrieves an array of alerts that were generated over the course of handling an endpoint. Getters and Setters for key data The current common case is a single numerical id GetType gives the name of the implementing struct GetAuditName returns the name of an object instance. If no name is availible, the id should be returned. "unknown" is the final case This should define the key getters and setters Create returns any user error, any system error, and the HTTP error code to be returned if there was an error. MultipleCreator indicates whether an object using the shared handlers allows an array of objects in the POST Read returns the object to write to the user, any user error, any system error, and the HTTP error code to be returned if there was an error. Update returns any user error, any system error, and the HTTP error code to be returned if there was an error. Delete returns any user error, any system error, and the HTTP error code to be returned if there was an error. OptionsDeleter calls the OptionsDelete() generic CRUD function, unlike Deleter, which calls Delete(). OptionsDelete returns any user error, any system error, and the HTTP error code to be returned if there was an error. Validator objects return user and system errors based on validation rules defined by that object. APIInfoer is an interface that guarantees the existence of a variable through its setters and getters. Every CRUD operation uses this login session context. APIInfoImpl implements APIInfo via the APIInfoer interface. The purpose of this is somewhat unclear. SetInfo sets the APIInfo of the APIInfoImpl to the given Info. The purpose of APIInfo returns the APIInfoer's Info. The purpose of this is somewhat unclear./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/apicapability/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/apicapability/api_capabilities.goGetAPICapabilitiesHandlergetAPICapabilitiesapiCapsqueryParamsToQueryColsselectQueryapicapabilitySELECT id, http_method, route, capability, last_updated FROM api_capability`SELECT id, http_method, route, capability, last_updated FROM api_capability`capability"capability"httpMethod"httpMethod"http_method"http_method""route""lastUpdated"last_updated"last_updated"query exception: could not build api_capability query with params: %v, error: %w"query exception: could not build api_capability query with params: %v, error: %w"closing APICapability rows"closing APICapability rows"api capability read: scanning: %w"api capability read: scanning: %w" Package apicapability defines the API handlers for Traffic Ops's API's /api_capabilities endpoint.

Validate fulfills the api.Validator interface. only validate it's boolean root tenant has no parent copy IsTenantAuthorized implements the Tenantable interface for TOTenant returns true if the user has access on this tenant and on the ParentID if changed. modifying an existing tenant not changing parent get current parentID to check if it's being changed If it's the root tenant, don't check for parent parent not being changed creating new tenant -- must specify a parent Update wraps tenant validation and the generic API Update call into a single call. isUpdatable peforms validation on the fields for the Tenant, such as ensuring the tenant cannot be modified if it is root, or that it cannot convert its own child to its own parent. This is different than the basic validation rules performed in Validate() as it pertains to specific business logic, not generic API rules. Perform SelectQuery Ensure the new desired ParentID does not exist in the susequent list of Children this is why we can't use api.GenericDelete parseDeleteErr takes the tenant delete error, and returns the appropriate user error, system error, and http status code. TODO fix this to check for other Postgres errors besides key violations selectQuery returns a query on the tenant table that limits to tenants within the realm of the tenantID.

See: http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/MIK/Crypt-ScryptKDF-0.010/lib/Crypt/ScryptKDF.pm The SCRYPT prefix is added because the Mojolicious Perl library adds this as a prefix to every password in the database.

Because the coordinate id is recieved from the cachegroup table, not being able to find the coordinate is equivalent to not being able to find the cachegroup.

It returns the async status ID, a bool indicating whether the refresh job was started or not, an HTTP status, a user error, and a system error. doDNSSECKeyRefresh takes ownership of tx and MUST close it. doDNSSECKeyRefresh refreshes the CDN's DNSSEC keys, as necessary. This takes ownership of tx, and MUST call `tx.Close()`. This SHOULD only be called if setInDNSSECKeyRefresh() returned true, in which case this MUST call unsetInDNSSECKeyRefresh() before returning. TODO change to return a slice, map is slow and unnecessary TODO get all in a map beforehand "key_expiration" in the Perl this was transliterated from -1 to subtract getDNSSECKeyRefreshParams returns returns the CDN's profile's tld.ttls.DNSKEY, DNSKEY.effective.multiplier, and DNSKEY.generation.multiplier parameters. If either parameter doesn't exist, nil is returned. If a CDN exists, but has no parameters, it is returned as a key in the map with a nil value. no DNSKEY parameters, but the CDN still exists. inDNSSECKeyRefresh is whether the server is currently processing a refresh in the background. This is used to only perform 1 refresh at a time. This MUST NOT be changed outside of atomic operations. This MUST NOT be changed to a boolean, or set without atomics. Atomic semantics involve more than just setting a memory location. setInDNSSECKeyRefresh attempts to set whether the server is currently executing a DNSSEC key refresh operation. Returns false if a refresh operation is already executing. If this returns true, the caller MUST call unsetInDNSSECKeyRefresh(). unsetInDNSSECKeyRefresh sets the flag indicating that the server is currently executing a DNSSEC key refresh operation to false.

Fufills `Identifier' interface Fufills `Create' interface non-panicking type assertion Fulfills `Validate' interface cname regex: (^\S*\.$), ttl regex: (^\d+$) fedAPIInfo.Params["name"] is not used on creation, rather the cdn name is connected when the federations/:id/deliveryservice links a federation However, we use fedAPIInfo.Params["name"] to check whether or not another user has a hard lock on the CDN. Note: cdns and deliveryservies have a 1-1 relationship Deliveryservice IDs should not be included on create. returning true indicates the data related to the given tenantID should be visible `tenantIDs` is presumed to be unsorted, and a nil tenantID is viewable by everyone Deliveryservice IDs should not be included on update. Delete implements the Deleter interface for TOCDNFederation. If nobody has claimed a tenant, that federation is publicly visible. This logically follows /federations/:id/deliveryservices TODO: use IsResourceAuthorizedToUserTx instead WHERE federation.id = :id (determined by dbhelper) Read handles GET requests to `cdns/{{name}}/federations`. ReadID handles GET requests to `cdns/{{name}}/federations/{{ID}}`. Create handles POST requests to `cdns/{{name}}/federations`. You can't set this at creation time, but if it was in the request it would be shown in the response - we're supposed to ignore extra fields. This doesn't do that exactly, but it helps. Update handles PUT requests to `cdns/{{name}}/federations/{{id}}`. You can't set this via a PUT request, but if it was in the request it Delete handles DELETE requests to `cdns/{{name}}/federations/{{id}}`./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/cdni/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/cdni/capacity.goAllFootprintQueryAsnCapabilityQueryCapabilityQueryResponseCapacityCapabilityValueCapacityLimitCapacityLimitTypeCapacityRequestedLimitsConfigurationUpdateRequestDeleteCapabilityUpdateQueryEgressFciCapacityLimitsFciTelemetryFootprintFootprintTypeGenericGenericHostMetadataGenericMetadataGenericRequestMetadataGetRequestsHostMetadataListInsertCapabilityUpdateQueryIpv4CidrIpv6CidrLimitScopeLimitsQueryResponseMetricMiRequestedCapacityLimitsPutConfigurationPutConfigurationResponsePutHostConfigurationRequestsSelectAllCapabilityUpdatesQuerySelectCapabilityUpdateQuerySessionsStorageObjectsStorageSizeSupportedCapabilitiesSupportedGenericMetadataTypeTelemetryTelemetryCapabilityValueTelemetryConfigurationTelemetrySourceTelemetrySourceTypeUpdateLimitsByCapabilityAndLimitTypeQuerycheckBearerTokendeleteCapabilityRequestgetBearerTokengetCapabilityIdFromFootprintsgetCapacitiesgetFootprintMapgetLimitsMapgetTelemetriesgetTelemetriesMapgetTelemetryMetricsMaphostConfigLabelhostQuerylimitsQueryvalidateHostExistsreturnedTotalLimitfciCaplimitsreturnedLimitscapRowsfciCapsfootprintMaplimitsMapcdnijson:"footprint-type" db:"footprint_type"FootprintValuejson:"footprint-value" db:"footprint_value"CapabilityIdCapabilityTypejson:"capability-type"CapabilityValuejson:"capability-value"Footprintsjson:"footprints"json:"capabilities"SELECT id, type, ucdn FROM cdni_capabilities WHERE type = $1 AND ucdn = $2FCI.CapacityLimitsclosing capabilities query"closing capabilities query"UCdnscanning db rows: %w"scanning db rows: %w"ScopeTypejson:"type" db:"scope_type"ScopeValuejson:"value" db:"scope_value"json:"scope,omitempty"LimitIdjson:"limitId" db:"limit_id"LimitTypejson:"limitType" db:"limit_type"MaximumHardjson:"maximum_hard" db:"maximum_hard"MaximumSoftjson:"maximum_soft" db:"maximum_soft"TelemetryIdjson:"telemetry_id" db:"telemetry_id"TelemetryMeticjson:"telemetry_metric" db:"telemetry_metric"json:"metric"json:"limit-type"json:"maximum-hard"json:"maximum-soft"json:"telemetry-source"Limitsjson:"limits"`json:"scope,omitempty"``json:"limitId" db:"limit_id"``json:"limitType" db:"limit_type"``json:"maximum_hard" db:"maximum_hard"``json:"maximum_soft" db:"maximum_soft"``json:"telemetry_id" db:"telemetry_id"``json:"telemetry_metric" db:"telemetry_metric"``json:"type" db:"scope_type"``json:"value" db:"scope_value"` CapabilityQueryResponse contains data about the capability query.

Host is a structure that holds the host info for the backend route. BackendRoute holds all the information about a configured route, for which Traffic Ops serves as a reverse proxy. BackendConfig is a structure that holds the configuration supplied to Traffic Ops, which makes it act as a reverse proxy to the specified routes. Config reflects the structure of the cdn.conf file ConfigTrafficOpsGolang carries settings specific to traffic_ops_golang server Deprecated in 5.0 end deprecatedMoved from Hypnotoad-listen section Deprecated: use 'port' in traffic_vault_config instead. CRConfigUseRequestHost is whether to use the client request host header in the CRConfig. If false, uses the tm.url parameter. This defaults to false. Traffic Ops used to always use the host header, setting this true will resume that legacy behavior. See https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/2224 Deprecated: will be removed in the next major version. CRConfigEmulateOldPath is whether to emulate the legacy CRConfig request path when generating a new CRConfig. This primarily exists in the event a tool relies on the legacy path '/tools/write_crconfig'. RoutingBlacklist contains a list of route IDs that are disabled, and whether or not to ignore unknown routes. ConfigTO contains information to identify Traffic Ops in a network sense. ConfigPortal contains information that can direct users to a friendly UI ConfigSMTP contains configuration information for connecting to and authenticating with an SMTP ConfigLetsEncrypt contains configuration information for integration with the Let's Encrypt certificate authority.

Note the delivery service may still be in the CRConfig! Therefore, this should only be called immediately after a CRConfig Snapshot. This creates a goroutine, and immediately returns. It returns an error if there was an error preparing the delete routine, such as an error creating a db transaction. Note because it is asynchronous, this may return a nil error, but the asynchronous goroutine may error when fetching or deleting the certificates. If such an error occurs, it will be logged to the error log. If certificate deletion is already being processed by a goroutine, another delete will be queued, and this immediately returns nil. Only one delete will ever be queued. deleteOldDSCerts deletes the HTTPS certificates in Riak of delivery services which have been deleted in Traffic Ops. deleteOldDSCertsDB takes a db, and creates a transaction to pass to deleteOldDSCerts. startOldCertDeleter tells the old cert deleter goroutine to start another delete job, creating the goroutine if it doesn't exist. cleanupOldCertDeleters stops all cert deleter goroutines for CDNs which have been deleted in the database. Any error is logged, but not returned. This is designed to be called when starting a new cert deleter job, to clean up any old cert deleters from deleted CDNs. This should only be called immediately when snapshotting, and immediately after startOldCertDeleter, because otherwise a cert deleter may be removed before it can delete old certs for a given CDN.

` Package deliveryservice contains logic and handlers for /deliveryservices and related sub-routes (e.g. /deliveryservices/{{ID}}/servers). TODeliveryService is a CRUDder implementation for Delivery Services; it's only used for GET and DELETE requests. TODeliveryServiceOldDetails is used to store the "old" details while updating a DS. MarshalJSON implements encoding/json.Marshaler. UnmarshalJSON implements encoding/json.Unmarshaler. APIInfo implements github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.APIInfoer. SetKeys implements part of the github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.Identifier GetKeys implements part of the GetKeyFieldsInfo implements part of the GetAuditName implements part of the GetType implements part of the IsTenantAuthorized implements the github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.Tenantable GetDSTLSVersions retrieves the TLS versions explicitly supported by a Delivery Service identified by dsID. This will panic if handed a nil transaction. CreateV30 is used to handle POST requests to create a Delivery Service at version 3.0 of the Traffic Ops API. CreateV31 is used to handle POST requests to create a Delivery Service at version 3.1 of the Traffic Ops API. CreateV50 is used to handle POST requests to create a Delivery Service at version 5.0 of the Traffic Ops API. CreateV40 is used to handle POST requests to create a Delivery Service at version 4.0 of the Traffic Ops API (and isomorphic API versions thereof, with respect to Delivery Service representations). CreateV41 is a handler for POST requests to create Delivery Services in version 4.1 of the Traffic Ops API. 'ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING' should be unnecessary because all data should be dumped from the table before re-insertion, but it's also harmless because the only conflict that could occur is a fully duplicate row, which is fine since we're intending to create that data anyway. Although it is weird. createV40 creates the given ds in the database, and returns the DS with its id and other fields created on insert set. On error, the HTTP status code, user error, and system error are returned. The status code SHOULD NOT be used, if both errors are nil. createV41 creates the given Delivery Service in the database, and returns a reference to the Delivery Service with its ID and other fields which are created on insert set. On error, an HTTP status code, user error, and system error are returned. The status code SHOULD NOT be used, if both errors are createV50 creates the given Delivery Service in the database, and returns a TODO change DeepCachingType to implement sql.Valuer and sql.Scanner, so sqlx struct scan can be used. necessary, because DeepCachingType's default needs to insert the string, not "", and Query doesn't call .String(). Read implements the github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.Reader interface (given that github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.APIInfoer is already implemented). UpdateV30 is used to handle PUT requests to update a Delivery Service in UpdateV31 is used to handle PUT requests to update a Delivery Service in UpdateV40 is used to handle PUT requests to update a Delivery Service in UpdateV41 is used to handle PUT requests to update a Delivery Service in version 4.1 of the Traffic Ops API (and isomorphic API versions thereof, with UpdateV50 is used to handle PUT requests to update a Delivery Service in version 5.0 of the Traffic Ops API (and isomorphic API versions thereof, with query the DB for existing 3.1 fields in order to "upgrade" this 3.0 request into a 3.1 request need to get the domain again, in case it changed. the update may change or delete the query params -- delete existing and re-add if any provided Delete implements the github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.Deleter interface (given that the and interfaces are already implemented). Note ds regexes MUST be deleted before the ds, because there's a ON DELETE CASCADE on deliveryservice_regex (but not on regex). Likewise, it MUST happen in a transaction with the later DS delete, so they aren't deleted if the DS delete fails. DeleteQuery implements part of the github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/v8/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/api.GenericDeleter addActive adds the query parameter for a DS's "active" state for the appropriate given API version to the provided 'WHERE' clause, and updates queryValues with the client-provided value from params as necessary. TODO: is this necessary? Validate checks that the given Delivery Service is valid according to various criteria. *It also modifies the given DS under certain circumstances, providing default values to some properties when they are zero-valued or nil references*. This will panic if either argument is nil. The error returned is safe for clients to see. validateTypeFields validates the TypeName-related field. Per Slice Plugin implementation 256KiB 32MiB TODO combine with getOldDetails, to only make one query? the update is removing the existing orgServerFQDN, so the existing row needs to be deleted orgServerFQDN is going from null to not null, so the primary origin needs to be created DSWithLegacyFields contains a Delivery Service along with associated fields that have been removed from its representation(s). GetDeliveryServices can be used with a valid query and map of values to retrieve Delivery Services from the database. Note that Tenancy must be built into the query already. The returned Delivery Services come with accompanying information about fields that have been removed from the model, in case a legacy handler needs that information. ensure json generated from this slice won't come out as `null` if empty ensure unique and in consistent order MakeExampleURLs creates the example URLs for a delivery service. The dsProtocol may be nil, if the delivery service type doesn't have a protocol (e.g. ANY_MAP). GetDeliveryServicesMatchLists retrieves "Match Lists" for each of the Delivery Services having the provided XMLID(s). The error return value is not safe to return to clients. EnsureParams ensures the given delivery service's necessary parameters exist on profiles of servers assigned to the delivery service. Note the edgeHeaderRewrite, midHeaderRewrite, regexRemap may be nil, if the delivery service does not have those values. EnsureCacheURLParams ensures the given delivery service's cachrurl parameters exist on profiles of servers assigned to the delivery service. live local DSes don't get header rewrite rules on the mid so cleanup any location params related to mids createDSLocationProfileParams adds the given parameter to all profiles assigned to servers which are assigned to the given delivery service. ensureLocation ensures a location parameter exists for the given config file. If not, it creates one, with the same value as the 'remap.config' file parameter. Returns the ID of the location parameter. getTenantID returns a pointer to the tenant ID of the given Delivery Service, or any error encountered while determining said ID. This will panic if the transaction is nil. getDSTenantIDByID returns the tenant ID, whether the delivery service exists, and any error. getDSTenantIDByName returns the tenant ID, whether the delivery service exists, and any error. GetXMLID loads the DeliveryService's xml_id from the database, from the ID. Returns whether the delivery service was found, and any error. getSSLVersion reports a boolean value, confirming whether DS has a SSL version or not.

The overrideTTL parameter determines whether to reuse existing key TTLs if they exist, or to override existing TTLs with the ttl parameter's value. genKeys generates keys for DNSSEC for a delivery service. Returns the public key, private key, and DS record (which will be nil if ksk or tld is false). This emulates the old Perl Traffic Ops behavior: the public key is of the RFC1035 single-line zone file format, base64 encoded; the private key is of the BIND private-key-file format, base64 encoded; the DSRecord contains the algorithm, digest type, and digest. 5 - http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml Note: currently, the Router appears to hard-code this in what it generates for the DS record (or at least the "Publish this" log message).

Notably, this adds the full DS Record text to CDN KSKs ZSKs don't have DSRecords, so we don't need to check here note this is replacing the actual string slash-n not a newline. Because Perl. ksk.Public isn't just the public key, it's the RFC 1035 single-line zone file format: "name ttl IN DNSKEY flags protocol algorithm keyBytes". the Riak ksk.Public key is actually the RFC1035 single-line zone file format.

Otherwise, return false. decode, verify, and order certs for storage decode and verify the server certificate Common x509 certificate validation RSA is both a digital signature and encryption algorithm, hence the key encipherment usage must be indicated in the certificate. The keyUsage and extended Key Usage does not exist in version 1 of the x509 specificication. Extract the RSA public key from the x509 certificate Attempt to decode the RSA private key Check RSA private key modulus against the x509 RSA public key modulus Only permit ECDSA support for DNS* DSTypes until the Traffic Router can support it DSA and ECDSA is not an encryption algorithm and only a signing algorithm, hence the certificate only needs to have the DigitalSignature KeyUsage indicated. Attempt to decode the ECDSA private key Extract the ECDSA public key from the x509 certificate Compare the ECDSA curve name contained within the x509.PublicKey against the curve name indicated in the private key Verify that ECDSA public value X matches in both the cert.PublicKey and the private key. Verify that ECDSA public value Y matches in both the cert.PublicKey and the private key. verify the certificate chain. Include all certificates in the chain, since verification was successful. validate certificate is a server auth certificate if the extension is present ensure that the certificate uses a supported PKI algorithm and a public key is present. ensure that the certificate is signed with supported algorithm Common privateKey validation logic. Reject unsupported encrypted private keys Check for encrypted keys or other unsupported key types Check block headers for encryption. decode the private key check for proper algorithm. check for correct number of keys return private key object, cleaned private key PEM, or any errors. Remove any white space before decoding Capture all key decode errors and collapse them at the end RSA Private Key Check for proper key count before attempting to decode. Attempt to decode pem encoded text into PEM block. Check that the key was decoded and validate key isn't encrypted and other common validation shared between PKI algorithms Decode PKCS#8 - RSA Private Key Determine if the privateKey is of the correct type Decode PKCS#1 - RSA Private Key ECDSA keys can have 1 or 2 PEM blocks if the 'EC PARAM' block is included. Check for at least one END marker Attempt to decode the first PEM Block Check if this pem block has 'KEY' contained in the type and try to decode it. First try to parse an EC key the normal way, before attempting PKCS8 Second, try to parse PEM block as a PKCS#8 formatted RSA Private Key.

TODO: figure out how to modify 'AddTenancyCheck' so this isn't necessary. getOriginals fetches the Delivery Services identified in 'ids' and sets them as originals on the Delivery Services to which each ID maps in needOriginals. It returns a response code to use if an error occurred, in which case it also returns a user error and a system error. Get is the GET handler for /deliveryservice_requests. TODO: add this functionality to the query builder in dbhelpers isTenantAuthorized ensures the user is authorized on the DSR's DeliveryService's Tenant, as appropriate to the change type. No deliveryservice applied yet or change type doesn't require an original Warning: this assumes inf isn't nil, and neither is dsr, inf.Tx or inf.User or inf.Tx.Tx. dsrManipulationResult encodes the result of manipulating a DSR. Action is the action performed to manipulate the DSR. Assignee is a pointer to the name of the user assigned to a DSR - or nil if there isn't one. ChangeType is the DSR's change type. Successful is whether or not the manipulation encountered no errors. XMLID is the XMLID of the Delivery Service affected by the DSR. String constructs a changelog message for the result. Unsuccessful results do not have a changelog message. first, ensure there's not an active request with this XMLID Post is the handler for POST requests to /deliveryservice_requests. Delete is the handler for DELETE requests to /deliveryservice_requests. Put is the handler for PUT requests to /deliveryservice_requests. isActiveRequest returns true if a request using this XMLID is currently in an active state./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/deliveryservice/request/status.godsrID

 TODeliveryServiceRequest provides a type alias to define functions on Validate fulfills the api.Validator interface ReadDSSHandler is the handler for GET requests to /deliveryserviceserver. statusnotmodified NOTE: if the 'orderby' query param exists but has an empty value, that means no ordering should be done. If the 'orderby' query param does not exist, order by "deliveryService" by default. This allows clients to specifically skip sorting if it's unnecessary, reducing load on the DB. TODO refactor to use dbhelpers.AddTenancyCheck GetReplaceHandler is the handler for POST requests to the /deliveryserviceserver API endpoint. delete existing GetCreateHandler is the handler for POST requests to /deliveryservices/{{XMLID}}/servers. get list of server Ids to insert this happens when the names they gave don't exist validateDSSAssignments returns an error if the given servers cannot be assigned to the given delivery service. We dont check for the cache type to be = EDGE here because if this is a new DS, and we want to assign an online/ reported ORG to it, we should be able to do that. Prevent the user from deleting all the servers in an active, non-topology-based DS prevent the user from deleting all ORG servers from an active, MSO-enabled DS The following check is necessary because of the following: Consider a brand new active DS that has no server assignments. Now, you wish to assign an online/ reported ORG server to it. Since this is a new DS and it didnt have any "pre existing" online/ reported EDGEs, this should be possible. However, if that DS had a couple of online/ reported EDGEs assigned to it, and now if you wanted to "replace" that assignment with the new assignment of an online/ reported ORG, this should be prohibited by TO. CheckServersInCachegroups checks whether or not all the given server cachegroups belong to the topology and returns a user error (if any). ValidateServerCapabilities checks that the delivery service's requirements are met by each server to be assigned. GetReadAssigned is the handler for GET requests to /deliveryservices/{id}/servers. Based on version we load Delivery Service Server - for version 5 and above we use DSServerV5 Read shows all of the delivery services associated with the specified server. GetDSInfo loads the DeliveryService fields needed by Delivery Service Servers from the database, from the ID. Returns the data, whether the delivery service was found, and any error. GetDSInfoByName loads the DeliveryService fields needed by Delivery Service Servers from the database, from the name (xml_id). Returns the data, whether the delivery service was found, and any error./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/deliveryservice/sslkeys.gocsrdefaultCertInfocdnNameStrdeliveryservice.GenerateSSLKeys: Traffic Vault is not configured"deliveryservice.GenerateSSLKeys: Traffic Vault is not configured"deliveryservice.GenerateSSLKeys: getting DS ID and CDN ID from name "deliveryservice.GenerateSSLKeys: getting DS ID and CDN ID from name "generating and putting SSL keys: "generating and putting SSL keys: "generating SSL keys for delivery service '"generating SSL keys for delivery service '", ACTION: Generated SSL keys", ACTION: Generated SSL keys"Successfully created ssl keys for "Successfully created ssl keys for "generating certificate: "generating certificate: "putting keys in Traffic Vault: "putting keys in Traffic Vault: "getting latest ssl keys for XMLID '%s': %w"getting latest ssl keys for XMLID '%s': %w"Placeholder"Placeholder"generating and putting SSL keys: %w"generating and putting SSL keys: %w"generating SSL keys for delivery service '%s': %w"generating SSL keys for delivery service '%s': %w" GenerateSSLKeys generates a new private key, certificate signing request and certificate based on the values submitted.

Checks if the current user's (identified in the api.Info) tenant has permissions to edit a Delivery Service. `ds` is expected to be the integral, unique identifer of the Delivery Service in question.

Various directories and filenames related to ISO generation. Default directory containing config file The JSON config file containing mapping of OS names to directories Config file name in the Perl version This is the directory name inside each OS directory where configuration files for kickstart scripts are placed. Configuration files that are generated inside the ks_scripts directory. Optional executable that is invoked instead of mkisofs Various database columns and values. ISOs handler is responsible for generating and returning an ISO image, as a streaming download. Response types: Error:	HTTP 400	{	  "alerts": [	    {"level":"error","text":"hostName is required"},	    {"level":"error","text":"disk is required"},	    ...,	  ] Success:	HTTP 200	Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="db.infra.ciab.test-centos72.iso"	Content-Type: application/download cmdOverwriteCtxKey is used in an http.Request's context to set a cmd override value. isos performs the majority of work for the /isos endpoint handler. It is separated out from the exported handler for testability. Ensure that the given OSVersionDir is defined in the osversions.json config file as a valid directory. This directory is later referenced for ISO creation and therefore must an allowed value. Determine the kickstart root directory, which is either a default value or may be overridden by a database/Parameter entry. cfgDir holds the kickstart config files within the root kickstart directory. Allow for the request context to carry a modifier function that can change the genISOCmd's command. This is purely used for testing. strings.ReplaceAll was added in Go 1.12 Create changelog entry At this point, it's not possible to modify the HTTP response. isoRequest represents the JSON object clients use to request an ISO be generated. validate returns an empty slice if the isoRequest is valid. Otherwise, it returns a slice of error messages. validateOSDir ensures that the OSDir value corresponds to a valid directory, as determined by the osversions.json config file. Since this directory is acted upon during ISO generation, it's important that it be valid. boolStr is used to decode boolean strings (e.g. "yes") as part of a JSON response. Part of the /isos JSON request generated by TrafficPortal uses this format. If an unrecognize or empty string is given, then the 'val' and 'isSet' fields will be false. Otherwise, 'isSet' will be true. false if UnmarshalText is given an unrecognized value UnmarshalText decodes strings representing boolean values. It nevers returns an error to allow for all validation errors to be grouped together. val returns the boolean value and whether the value was set or not./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/iso/mkisofs.gotmpDircustomExecisoFdcustomPathexecutablePermBitsbaseDirosVersionDirdiskCfgFdmgmtNetworkCfgFdnameserversnetworkCfgFdpasswordCfgFdstateFdisBondedcryptedPwgenISO"genISO"tmp.iso"tmp.iso"custom"custom"default"default"-joliet-long"-joliet-long"-input-charset"-input-charset"-b"-b"isolinux/isolinux.bin"isolinux/isolinux.bin"isolinux/boot.cat"isolinux/boot.cat"-no-emul-boot"-no-emul-boot"-boot-load-size"-boot-load-size""4"-boot-info-table"-boot-info-table"-R"-R"-J"-J"-T"-T"%v: %s"%v: %s"0111SELECT value FROM parameter WHERE name = $1 AND config_file = $2 LIMIT 1`SELECT value FROM parameter WHERE name = $1 AND config_file = $2 LIMIT 1`Dir== %s

The given ksDir is expected to be the root directory containing the kickstarter files of the desired OS. It will detect a custom `generate` executable if present, otherwise will use the default `mkisofs` command. The custom script must accept a single argument: The path where it will write the ISO. Here we create a temporary directory for this purpose. The cleanup method is responsible for removing it. streamISOCmd encapsulate the logic for executing the ISO generation command. Description of command: "default" or "custom" If empty, then cmd writes to STDOUT. Othewrise, cmd writes the ISO to this path. String returns the command that the stream method will execute. Note: Go 1.13 adds exec.Cmd#String method cleanup should be defered after calling newStreamISOCmd. It removes any temporary resources created. If the command doesn't need any cleanup, this is a no-op. stream writes to w the ISO data. Callers should always use this method and not the other more specific stream methods. streamStdout invokes the command and pipes its STDOUT to w. streamFromFile invokes the command and expects the ISO to be written to isoDest. It then copies the contents of that file to w. customGenISOPath returns the complete path to an alternative executable for generating the ISO. If not found, an empty string is returned. In order to be valid, the script/executable must:   - Be inside the ksDir and named "generate"   - Be executable (by somebody)   - Accept a single argument indicating where the resulting ISO image should be saved (not     verified by this function) Check if file exists and is executable. kickstarterDir returns the directory containing the kickstarter files for the given OS. This is the directory passed to the mkisofs command. The root part of the directory can be overriden with a Parameter database entry. writeKSCfgs writes to the given directory the various Kickstart configuration files using the data from the given isoRequest. The cmd string is used to log to a file the command that will be executed to create the ISO. Create state.out Create network.cfg Create mgmt_network.cfg Create password.cfg Empty salt parameter causes a random salt to be generated, which is the desired behavior. Create disk.cfg bondedRegex matches a bonded device interface name. writeNetworkCfg writes the network.cfg config to w. writeMgmtNetworkCfg writes the mgmt_network.cfg config to w. Test if management IP is IPv6 writeDiskCfg writes the disk.cfg config to w. writePasswordCfg writes the password.cfg config to w. The salt parameter is optional. If salt is blank, then a random 8-character salt will be used. configWriter is a helper type to create config files of format:	OPT="VALUE" addOpt adds an option to the config. addIP adds an IPv4 option to the config. It handles the case where the given IP is empty/nil. Avoid using `<nil>`, i.e. net.IP{}.String() = <nil> addBoolStr adds a BoolStr option to the config, using "yes" / "no" values. Read satisfies the io.Reader interface, and allows for using the configWriter by the io.Copy() function./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/iso/osversions.gostatErroldCfgPathThe configuration file for the /osversions endpoint has changed from %q to %q: %v"The configuration file for the /osversions endpoint has changed from %q to %q: %v" GetOSVersions returns a map of available Operating System (OS) versions for ISO generation, as well as the name of the directory where the "kickstarter" files are found. The returned data comes from a configuration file. There's a default location of the config file which can be overridden via a Parameter database entry. Note: The api.CRUDer interface could not be used for this endpoint because the original Perl endpoint returned a single JSON object, whereas the CRUDer interface returns an array of JSON objects per the Read method. getOSVersions is used in conjunction with GetOSVersions. It returns a mapping of OS names to their respective directories. Warn if the old Perl config file exists, but there's an error reading the file from the new location. osversionsCfgPath returns a path to the configuration file containing the OS versions data. The name of the configuration file is constant, but a specific Parameter database entry can update the directory where the file is expected./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/iso/resolve.go/etc/resolv.conf"/etc/resolv.conf"';'59"nameserver" readDefaultUnixResolve reads the /etc/resolv.conf file and parses out the nameservers. parseResolve parses r as a resolv.conf formatted string.

No certs provided by the client. Skip to form authentication If no configuration is set, skip to form auth Perform certificate verification to ensure it is valid against Root CAs Client provided a verified certificate. Extract UID value. Check if user exists locally (TODB) and has a role. Check LDAP if enabled LoginHandler first attempts to verify and parse user information from an optionally provided client TLS certificate. If it fails at any point, it will fall back and continue with the standard submitted form authentication. Attempt to perform client certificate authentication. If fails, goto standard form auth. If the certificate was verified, has a UID, and the UID matches an existing user we consider this to be a successful login. Failed certificate-based auth, perform standard form auth Perform form authentication Check if user exists and has a role User w/ role does not exist, return unauthorized Check local DB or LDAP Failed to authenticate in either local DB or LDAP, return unauthorized Successful authentication, write cookie and return log but do not error out since this is optional in the JWT for CDNi integration If all's well until here, then update last authenticated time TODO: afaik, Perl never clears these tokens. They should be reset to NULL on login, I think. Note: all calls to jwk.AutoRefresh should be conccurency-safe OauthLoginHandler accepts a JSON web token previously obtained from an OAuth provider, decodes it, validates it, authorizes the user against the database, and returns the login result as either an error or success message The jwk.AutoRefresh and jwk.Whitelist objects only get created once. They are shared between all handlers Note: This assumes two things: 1) that the cfg.ConfigTrafficOpsGolang.WhitelistedOAuthUrls is not updated once it has been initialized 2) OauthLoginHandler is not called conccurently Required by RFC6749 section 4.1.3 per RFC6749 section 2.3.1 TODO: consider concealing database state from unauthenticated parties; this should maybe just return a 2XX w/ success message at this point?RegisterURLTargetSnapshotNextRefreshLastRefresh/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/login/logout.go/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/login/register.gochangeLogreqV4

DefaultRequestTimeout is the default request timeout, if no timeout is configured. This should be used by all Traffic Ops routing, and is recommended for use by plugins. These are the different status values associated with an If-Modified-Since(IMS) request NONIMS when the request doesn't contain the If-Modified-Since header IMSHIT when a 304(Not Modified) was returned IMSMISS when anything other than a 304 was returned, meaning that something changed after the If-Modified-Since time of the request RouteID ServerName is the name and version of Traffic Ops. Things that print the server application name and version, for example in headers or logs, should use this. Middleware is an HTTP dispatch "middleware" function. A Middleware is a function which takes an http.HandlerFunc and returns a new http.HandlerFunc, typically wrapping the execution of the given handlerFunc with some additional behavior. For example, adding headers or gzipping the body. GetDefault returns the default middleware for Traffic Ops. This includes writing to the access log, a request timeout, default headers such as CORS, and compression. Use takes a slice of middlewares, and applies them in reverse order (which is the intuitive behavior) to the given HandlerFunc h. It returns a HandlerFunc which will call all middlewares, and then h.apply them in reverse order so they are used in a natural order. AuthBase is the basic authentication object for middleware. It contains the data required for authentication, as well as a function to get a Middleware to perform authentication. GetWrapper returns a Middleware which performs authentication of the current user at the given privilege level. The returned Middleware also adds the auth.CurrentUser object to the request context, which may be retrieved by a handler via api.NewInfo or auth.GetCurrentUser. TimeOutWrapper is a Middleware which adds the given timeout to the request. This causes the request to abort and return an error to the user if the handler takes longer than the timeout to execute. WrapHeaders is a Middleware which adds common headers and behavior to the handler. It specifically:   - Adds default CORS headers to the response.   - Adds the Whole-Content-SHA512 checksum header to the response.   - Gzips the response and sets the Content-Encoding header, if the client sent an Accept-Encoding: gzip header.   - Adds the Vary: Accept-Encoding header to the response WrapPanicRecover is a Middleware which adds a panic recover call to the given HandlerFunc h. If h throws an unhandled panic, an error is logged and an Internal Server Error is returned to the client. AccessLogTimeFormat is the time format of the access log, as used by time.Time.Format. GetWrapAccessLog returns a Middleware which writes to the Access Log (which is the lib/go-log EventLog) after the HandlerFunc finishes. WrapAccessLog takes the cookie secret and a http.Handler, and returns a HandlerFunc which writes to the Access Log (which is the lib/go-log EventLog) after the HandlerFunc finishes. This is not a Middleware, because it needs the secret as a parameter. For a Middleware, see GetWrapAccessLog. missing cookie will not throw error GzipResponse takes a function which cannot error and returns only bytes, and wraps it as a http.HandlerFunc. The errContext is logged if the write fails, and should be enough information to trace the problem (function name, endpoint, request parameters, etc). It gzips the given bytes and writes them to w, as well as writing the appropriate 'Content-Encoding: gzip' header, if the request included an 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' header. If the request doesn't accept gzip, the bytes are written to w unmodified.if not we assume it is a 200 GzipIfAccepts gzips the given bytes, writes a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the given writer, and returns the gzipped bytes, if the Request supports GZip (has an Accept-Encoding header). Else, returns the bytes unmodified. Note the given bytes are NOT written to the given writer. It is assumed the bytes may need to pass thru other middleware before being written. TODO: drichardson - refactor these to a generic area NotImplementedHandler returns a http.Handler which returns to the client a HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code, and a body which is a standard Traffic Ops error JSON. Note this is common usage in Traffic Ops for unimplemented endpoints (for example, which were impossible or impractical to rewrite from Perl). This is a something of a misuse of the HTTP spec. RFC 7231 states 501 Not Implemented is intended for HTTP Methods which are not implemented. However, it's not a clear violation of the Spec, and Traffic Ops has determined it is the safest and least ambiguous way to indicate endpoints which no longer or don't yet exist. DisabledRouteHandler returns a http.Handler which returns a HTTP 5xx code to the client, and an error message indicating the route is currently disabled. This is used for routes which have been disabled via configuration. See config.ConfigTrafficOpsGolang.RoutingBlacklist.DisabledRoutes. RequiredPermissionsMiddleware produces a Middleware that checks that the authenticated user has all of the passed Permissions. If they are missing one or more Permissions, an error is returned to the client and handling is terminated early. This will try to deduce the authenticated user regardless of Middleware order, but calling an AuthBase.GetWrapper-produced Middleware *after* this Middleware will result in extra db calls, so for best results this should always be used after that

Authenticated indicates that a route requires authentication for use. NoAuth indicates that a route does not require authentication for use. GetRouteIDMap takes a []int Route IDs and converts it into a map for fast lookup. Routes returns the API routes, raw non-API root level routes, and a catchall route for when no route matches. 1.1 and 1.2 routes are simply a Go replacement for the equivalent Perl route. They may or may not conform with the API guidelines (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TC/API+Guidelines). 1.3 routes exist only in Go. There is NO equivalent Perl route. They should conform with the API guidelines (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TC/API+Guidelines). 2.x routes exist only in Go. There is NO equivalent Perl route. They should conform with the API guidelines (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TC/API+Guidelines). NOTE: Route IDs are immutable and unique. DO NOT change the ID of an existing Route; otherwise, existing configurations may break. New Route IDs can be any integer between 0 and 2147483647 (inclusive), as long as it's unique.*

RoutePrefix is a prefix that all API routes must match. backendCfg stores the current backend config supplied to traffic ops. GetBackendConfig returns the current BackendConfig. SetBackendConfig sets the BackendConfig to the value supplied. A Route defines an association with a client request and a handler for that request. Order matters! Do not reorder this! Routes() uses positional construction for readability. unique ID for referencing this Route SetMiddleware sets up a Route's Middlewares to include the default set of Middlewares if necessary. a privLevel of zero is an unauthenticated endpoint. ServerData ... Yes this is a field in the config but we want to live reload this value and NOT the entire config CompiledRoute ... PathHandler ... CreateRouteMap returns a map of methods to a slice of paths and handlers; wrapping the handlers in the appropriate middleware. Uses Semantic Versioning: routes are added to every subsequent minor version, but not subsequent major versions. For example, a 1.2 route is added to 1.3 but not 2.1. Also truncates '2.0' to '2', creating succinct major versions. Returns the map of routes, and a map of API versions served. TODO strong types for method, path CompileRoutes - takes a map of methods to paths and handlers, and returns a map of methods to CompiledRoutes Handler - generic handler func used by the Handlers hooking into the routes plugins have no pre-parsed path params, but add an empty map so they can use the api helper funcs that require it. HandleBackendRoute does all the pre processing for the backend routes. IsRequestAPIAndUnknownVersion returns true if the request starts with `/api` and is a version not in the list of versions. path starts with `/api`, and version isn't a number, so it's an unknown/nonexistent version path starts with `/api` and version exists, so it's API but a known version path starts with `/api`, and version is unknown RegisterRoutes - parses the routes and registers the handlers with the Go Routerwe know d.Config.Secrets is a slice of at least one or start up would fail. nextReqIDGetter returns a function for getting incrementing identifiers. The returned func is safe for calling with multiple goroutines.

DeliveryServiceTenantInfo provides only deliveryservice info needed here IsTenantAuthorized returns true if the user has tenant access on this tenant GetDeliveryServiceTenantInfo returns tenant information for a deliveryservice Check checks that the given user has access to the given XMLID. Returns a user error, system error, and the HTTP status code to be returned to the user if an error occurred. On success, the user error and system error will both be nil, and the error code should be ignored. CheckID checks that the given user has access to the given delivery service. Returns a user error, a system error, and an HTTP error code. If both the user and system error are nil, the error code should be ignored. GetUserTenantListTx returns a Tenant list that the specified user has access to. GetUserTenantIDListTx returns a list of tenant IDs accessible to the given tenant. Note: If the given tenant or any of its parents are inactive, no IDs will be returned. If child tenants are needed even if the current tenant is inactive, use GetUserTenantListTx instead. IsResourceAuthorizedToUserTx returns a boolean value describing if the user has access to the provided resource tenant id and an error If the user tenant is inactive (or any of its parent tenants are inactive), false will be returned. GetDSTenantIDByIDTx returns the tenant ID, whether the delivery service exists, and any error. Note the id may be nil, even if true is returned, if the delivery service exists but its tenant_id field is null./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/test/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/test/error_context.goAddErrorCodeBadDupMessageBadErrorCodeBadFmtStringBadInitOrderBadMsgLookupColsFromStructByTagColsFromStructByTagExcludeErrorContextInternalErrorCodeInsertAtStrNewErrorNewErrorContextRandBoolRandFloat64RandIntRandInt64RandIntForActiveRandIntnRandStrRandStrArrayRandUintRandUint64RandomIPv4RandomIPv6SortErrorsSplitErrorserrorImpliotaRefsortableErrorsfmtArgscausePrependCausecodeMapcontextNamedescMaperrCodescalledNewErrorcreatedNewErrordoPanicTurnPanicOnSetDefaultMessageForCodeAddDefaultErrorMessagesinternalErrorwhitelistednewErrorGetErrorStatsoffendererrDesc%v %v"%v %v"-5-2error code %v not found in whitelist for "%s" error context`error code %v not found in whitelist for "%s" error context`code %v already has a default message for the "%s" error context`code %v already has a default message for the "%s" error context`-3bad default error lookup for code %v in the "%s" error context`bad default error lookup for code %v in the "%s" error context`-4the leading argument "%v" could not be interpreted as a format string`the leading argument "%v" could not be interpreted as a format string`tried to modify error context after creating error`tried to modify error context after creating error` Error describes an interface that supports error codes. It also allows for the first (causal) error to be easily referenced without needing to parse it. Adding error context is supported by prepending a string, and keeping the current error code. usage:	func func1() Error {		return test.NewError(404, "not found")	func func2() Error {		err := func1()		if err != nil {			return err.Prepend("while in func2: ")		}		err.Code()  // 404		err.Cause() // not found NewError constructs an error with a code. Code returns the integer error code that the error message is associated with. Prepend prepends the string built from fmtStr and fmtArgs to the error and returns it. Note is is not a pointer receiver, and does not modify itself. In the new error the original cause is maintained. Cause returns the original error made, without extra context. It implements the causer interface defined in the errors package. see:	https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pkg/errors#Cause AddErrorCode takes an error and returns an instance satisfying the Error interface. ErrorContext regulates which error codes can be made and keeps a count of all the errors created through the context. `ErrorContext.NewError` can be used like `test.NewError` (see Error above) The primary difference is that the context prevents non-whitelisted error codes from being made. Implementation details:	 contains a list of all valid error codes		- allows user to make sure they are creating the correct errors		- actually a map			lookup can be done without linear search			we can use the map to keep count of which errors are made	 contains mapping from error code to name/default message		- not required for all error codes, or for any An example setup:	package some_regex_checker		CommonBase            = 10 + iota		NotEnoughAssignments		BadAssignmentMatch		...	// scoped to the package name	var ErrorContext *test.ErrorContext	func init() {		errorCodes := []uint{			NotEnoughAssignments,			BadAssignmentMatch,		ErrorContext = test.NewErrorContext("cache config", errorCodes)		err := ErrorContext.SetDefaultMessageForCode(NotEnoughAssignments, "not enough assignments in rule")		// check err		ErrorContext.TurnPanicOn()		// create a new user error with the context like this		err := ErrorContext.NewError(BadAssignmentMatch, "bad assignment match")		// there is no error code with 0, so this panics		err = ErrorContext.NewError(0, "some error msg") codes is both a whitelist of codes and a count of which error codes have been called. description is a map from an error code to a default error message. NewErrorContext constructs an error context with list of valid codes. TurnPanicOn enables panic mode. When panic mode is on, ErrorContext methods that return errors will panic. Panic mode does not affect user-created errors. Panic mode can be used to assert the error context is set up correctly. Although golang panics are highly discouraged, panic mode is made as an option. This decision was partially made because type assertions and map membership have similar options. If a user doesn't have panic mode on, they should still terminate after running into an error. Panic is off by default, and must be turned on explicitly so that the user must make an active decision. Panic must be turned on before errors are created. Once turned on, panic mode can't be turned off. SetDefaultMessageForCode gives a default message for a given error code. Default messages must be configured before errors are created. parameters:	`code` should exist in the error context, only one default message mapping can exist per error context	`msg` should be a plain string without special formatting	ErrorContext.SetDefaultMessageForCode(404, "not found")	// err has a default message	err := ErrorContext.NewError(404)	// the default message is overridden to add context to the error	err := ErrorContext.NewError(404, "not found: %v", prev_err") AddDefaultMessages applies the SetDefaultMessageForCode function for every element in the given map. The function does not override the current contents of the map, everything is additive. An error is returned if a duplicate code is added. parameter:	`mapping` is a map of error codes to their default error messages All internal errors for ErrorContext when a bad error code is given in creation of new error when a default message already exists when creating an error with no error message, default message wasn't found when the fmt string isn't a string when the error context is modifed after having created an error internalError returns an error with a message depending on the error code given. The offender is the single item that the error is blamed on. Most offenders are an incorrect code. whitelisted is defined by code map membership newError makes sure every created error gets counted NewError for an ErrorContext creates an error similar to test.NewError Any error created in this manner must have a code that belongs to the error context. The args is interpreted as a format string with args, but `...interface{}` is used because if no args are specified a lookup will be made to find the default configured string (see SetDefaultMessageForCode)	cxt.NewError(404, "not found: %v", prev_err)	cxt.NewError(404) // (default message must exist otherwise this is an error) if no args given, try to find a default if args given, interpret as (fmtStr, fmtArgs) AddErrorCode takes a regular error and gives it a code. Since this method is scoped to an error context, the code must exist in the whitelist. GetErrorStats returns the map of error codes.	stats := cxt.GetErrorStats()	stats[code] // represents the number of times an error with the code has been created/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/test/helpers.goinsertsnewIndexcolLeninsertLeninsertMapnewColumnsoldIndexexcludeColumnsexcludeMap ColsFromStructByTag extracts the tag annotations from a struct into a string array.

GetAlerts implements the AlertsResponse interface. DeleteQueryBase holds a delete query with no WHERE clause and is a requirement of the api.GenericOptionsDeleter interface. ParamColumns maps query parameters to their respective database columns. GenericOptionsDeleter is required by the api.GenericOptionsDeleter interface and is called by api.GenericOptionsDelete(). GetKeyFieldsInfo is a requirement of the api.Updater interface. GetType returns the human-readable type of TOTopology as a string. DowngradeTopologyNodes downgrades v5 topology nodes into legacy topology node structures. ValidateTopology validates a v5 topology to make sure that the supplied fields are valid.Get current Topology-CG for the requested change. Only perform further checks if everything so far is valid  Validate is a requirement of the api.Validator interface. Build the list of topologies containing each cache group Add nodes for the topology we are validating Get an index for each cachegroup Reduce parentMapMap to an array of TopologyNodes We can't rely on iterating through parentMapMap in the same order twice, so we iterate through cacheGroups instead getDSRequiredCapabilitiesByTopology returns a map of DS xml_id to required capabilities, a map of xml_id to cdn_id, and an error (if one occurs). SetKeys is a requirement of the api.Updater interface and is called by api.UpdateHandler(). GetAuditName is a requirement of the api.Identifier interface. Create is the handler for creating a new topology entity in api version 5.0. Create is a requirement of the api.Creator interface. Read is the handler for reading topologies in api version 5.0. Delete is the handler for removing a topology entity in api version 5.0. Update is the handler for modifying a topology entity in api version 5.0. Read is a requirement of the api.Reader interface and is called by api.ReadHandler(). Update is a requirement of the api.Updater interface. Delete is unused and simply satisfies the Deleter interface (although TOTOpology is used as an OptionsDeleter) OptionsDelete is a requirement of the OptionsDeleter interface./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/topology/topology_validation/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/topology/topology_validation/topology_validation.goselectEmptyCacheGroupsQueryscanTotopologiesForRowtopologySetmessageEntryerrMessageemptyCachegroupsByCDNcachegroupsInTopologycgServerCountscgServerCountsByCDNemptyCachegroupsexcludeServerIdsserverCountByCDNtopologiesByCachegrouptopologySetByCachegroupjoinTopologyCachegroupstopologyNamesunable to check for cachegroups with no servers"unable to check for cachegroups with no servers"checking for cachegroups with no servers: %s"checking for cachegroups with no servers: %s"cachegroup_ids"cachegroup_ids"exclude_server_ids"exclude_server_ids"unable to close DB connection when checking for cachegroups with no servers"unable to close DB connection when checking for cachegroups with no servers" (in topologies: " (in topologies: "cachegroups with no servers in them: "cachegroups with no servers in them: "topology is assigned to delivery service on CDN %d, but that CDN has no servers"topology is assigned to delivery service on CDN %d, but that CDN has no servers"topology is assigned to delivery service(s) on CDN %d, but the following cachegroups have no servers in CDN %d: %s"topology is assigned to delivery service(s) on CDN %d, but the following cachegroups have no servers in CDN %d: %s"

postgres provides a TrafficVault implementation which uses PostgreSQL as the backend. GetDeliveryServiceSSLKeys retrieves the SSL keys of the given version for the delivery service identified by the given xmlID. If version is empty, the implementation should return the latest version. GetExpirationInformation returns the expiration information for all SSL Keys. PutDeliveryServiceSSLKeys stores the given SSL keys for a delivery service. delete the old ssl keys first insert the new ssl keys now DeleteDeliveryServiceSSLKeys removes the SSL keys of the given version (or latest if version is empty) for the delivery service identified by the given xmlID. DeleteOldDeliveryServiceSSLKeys takes a set of existingXMLIDs as input and will remove all SSL keys for delivery services in the CDN identified by the given cdnName that do not contain an xmlID in the given set of existingXMLIDs. This method is called during a snapshot operation in order to delete SSL keys for delivery services that no longer exist. GetCDNSSLKeys retrieves all the SSL keys for delivery services in the CDN identified by the given cdnName.

TrafficVault defines the methods necessary for a struct to implement in order to provide all the necessary functionality required of a Traffic Vault backend. NOTE: the ctx context.Context in these methods is for the HTTP request context in order to cancel the request if the HTTP connection is closed. If the method is called asynchronously in a goroutine that is spawned while handling the original HTTP request, you should use context.Background() so that the context isn't cancelled when the original HTTP connection is closed. GetExpirationInformation retrieves the SSL key expiration information for all delivery services. GetDNSSECKeys retrieves all the DNSSEC keys associated with the CDN identified by the given cdnName. PutDNSSECKeys stores all the DNSSEC keys for the CDN identified by the given cdnName. DeleteDNSSECKeys removes all the DNSSEC keys for the CDN identified by the given cdnName. GetURLSigKeys retrieves the URL sig keys for the delivery service identified by the given xmlID. PutURLSigKeys stores the given URL sig keys for the delivery service identified by the given xmlID. DeleteURLSigKeys deletes the URL sig keys for the delivery service identified by the given xmlID. GetURISigningKeys retrieves the URI signing keys (as raw JSON bytes) for the delivery service identified by the given xmlID. PutURISigningKeys stores the given URI signing keys (as raw JSON bytes) for the delivery DeleteURISigningKeys removes the URI signing keys for the delivery service identified by Ping simply checks the health of the Traffic Vault backend, returning a status and which server hostname the status was returned by. GetBucketKey returns the raw bytes identified by the given bucket and key. This may not apply to every Traffic Vault backend implementation. Deprecated: this method and associated API routes will be removed in the future. A LoadFunc is a function that takes a json.RawMessage as input (the contents of traffic_vault_config in cdn.conf) and returns a valid TrafficVault as output. Each TrafficVault implementation should define its own LoadFunc which is responsible for parsing the given configuration and returning a valid TrafficVault implementation that may be used by request handlers. AddBackend should be called by each TrafficVault backend package's init() function in order to register its name and LoadFunc. This name corresponds to the traffic_vault_backend option in cdn.conf. GetBackend is called with the contents of the traffic_vault_backend and traffic_vault_config options in cdn.conf, respectively, in order to lookup and load the chosen Traffic Vault backend to use./Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/types/Users/test/Desktop/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/types/types.goactualUseInTableforCreationtypeListrequestedIdtyp.name"typ.name"typ.id"typ.id""useInTable"typ.use_in_table"typ.use_in_table"use_in_table"use_in_table"can not update type"can not update type"can not delete type"can not delete type"can not create type"can not create type"SELECT use_in_table from type where id=$1`SELECT use_in_table from type where id=$1`no type with that key found"no type with that key found" typ ` typ ` UNION ALL

Channel for sending a "quit message" to the reader goroutine File descriptor (as returned by the kqueue() syscall). Protects access to watcher data Map of watched file descriptors (key: path). Map of watches added by user of the library. Map of watched directories to fflags used in kqueue. Map file descriptors to path names for processing kqueue events. Keep track of if we know this file exists (to stop duplicate create events). Set to true when Close() is first called NewWatcher establishes a new watcher with the underlying OS and begins waiting for events. Close removes all watches and closes the events channel. copy paths to remove while locked unlock before calling Remove, which also locks send a "quit" message to the reader goroutine Add starts watching the named file or directory (non-recursively). Remove stops watching the the named file or directory (non-recursively). Find all watched paths that are in this directory that are not external. Since these are internal, not much sense in propagating error to the user, as that will just confuse them with an error about a path they did not explicitly watch themselves. Watch all events (except NOTE_EXTEND, NOTE_LINK, NOTE_REVOKE) keventWaitTime to block on each read from kevent addWatch adds name to the watched file set. The flags are interpreted as described in kevent(2). Returns the real path to the file which was added, if any, which may be different from the one passed in the case of symlinks. Make ./name and name equivalent We already have a watch, but we can still override flags. Don't watch sockets. Don't watch named pipes. Follow Symlinks Unfortunately, Linux can add bogus symlinks to watch list without issue, and Windows can't do symlinks period (AFAIK). To  maintain consistency, we will act like everything is fine. There will simply be no file events for broken symlinks. Hence the returns of nil on errors. Watch the directory if it has not been watched before, or if it was watched before, but perhaps only a NOTE_DELETE (watchDirectoryFiles) Store flags so this watch can be updated later readEvents reads from kqueue and converts the received kevents into Event values that it sends down the Events channel. See if there is a message on the "done" channel Get new events EINTR is okay, the syscall was interrupted before timeout expired. Flush the events we received to the Events channel Double check to make sure the directory exists. This can happen when we do a rm -fr on a recursively watched folders and we receive a modification event first but the folder has been deleted and later receive the delete event mark is as delete event Send the event on the Events channel. Look for a file that may have overwritten this. For example, mv f1 f2 will delete f2, then create f2. make sure the directory exists before we watch for changes. When we do a recursive watch and perform rm -fr, the parent directory might have gone missing, ignore the missing directory and let the upcoming delete event remove the watch from the parent directory. Move to next event cleanup only way the previous loop breaks is if w.done was closed so we need to async send to w.Errors. newEvent returns an platform-independent Event based on kqueue Fflags. watchDirectoryFiles to mimic inotify when adding a watch on a directory Get all files sendDirectoryEvents searches the directory for newly created files and sends them over the event channel. This functionality is to have the BSD version of fsnotify match Linux inotify which provides a create event for files created in a watched directory. Search for new files sendFileCreatedEvent sends a create event if the file isn't already being tracked. Send create event like watchDirectoryFiles (but without doing another ReadDir) mimic Linux providing delete events for subdirectories but preserve the flags used if currently watching subdirectory watch file to mimic Linux inotify kqueue creates a new kernel event queue and returns a descriptor. register events with the queue SetKevent converts int to the platform-specific types: register the events read retrieves pending events, or waits until an event occurs.

Note that with the x25519 scheme, the private key is a sequence of 32 bytes, while the public key is the result of X25519(private, basepoint). Portions of this file are from Go's ed25519.go, which is Copyright 2016 The Go Authors. All rights reserved. PublicKeySize is the size, in bytes, of public keys as used in this package. PrivateKeySize is the size, in bytes, of private keys as used in this package. SeedSize is the size, in bytes, of private key seeds. These are the private key representations used by RFC 8032. PublicKey is the type of X25519 public keys Any methods implemented on PublicKey might need to also be implemented on PrivateKey, as the latter embeds the former and will expose its methods. Equal reports whether pub and x have the same value. PrivateKey is the type of X25519 private key Public returns the PublicKey corresponding to priv. Equal reports whether priv and x have the same value. Seed returns the private key seed corresponding to priv. It is provided for interoperability with RFC 7748. RFC 7748's private keys correspond to seeds in this package. NewKeyFromSeed calculates a private key from a seed. It will return an error if len(seed) is not SeedSize. This function is provided for interoperability with RFC 7748. RFC 7748's private keys correspond to seeds in this package. GenerateKey generates a public/private key pair using entropy from rand. If rand is nil, crypto/rand.Reader will be used.ErrFieldTooLongErrHeaderErrInsecurePathErrWriteAfterCloseErrWriteTooLongFileInfoHeaderFileInfoNamesFormatGNUFormatPAXFormatUSTARFormatUnknownTypeBlockTypeCharTypeContTypeDirTypeFifoTypeGNULongLinkTypeGNULongNameTypeGNUSparseTypeLinkTypeRegTypeRegATypeSymlinkTypeXGlobalHeaderTypeXHeaderalignSparseEntriesbasicKeysblockPaddingblockSizec_ISBLKc_ISCHRc_ISDIRc_ISFIFOc_ISGIDc_ISLNKc_ISREGc_ISSOCKc_ISUIDc_ISVTXdiscardensureEOFerrMissDataerrUnrefDataerrWriteHolefileReaderfileStatefileWriterfitsInBase256fitsInOctalformatMaxformatNamesformatPAXRecordformatPAXTimeformatSTARformatV7formattergroupMaphasNULheaderErrorheaderFileInfoheaderGNUheaderSTARheaderUSTARheaderV7invertSparseEntriesisASCIIisHeaderOnlyTypemagicGNUmagicUSTARmaxSpecialFileSizemergePAXmustReadFullnameSizenumberFormatterparsePAXparsePAXRecordparsePAXTimepaxAtimepaxCharsetpaxCommentpaxCtimepaxGNUSparsepaxGNUSparseMajorpaxGNUSparseMappaxGNUSparseMinorpaxGNUSparseNamepaxGNUSparseNumBlockspaxGNUSparseNumBytespaxGNUSparseOffsetpaxGNUSparseRealSizepaxGNUSparseSizepaxGidpaxGnamepaxLinkpathpaxMtimepaxNonepaxPathpaxSchilyXattrpaxSizepaxUidpaxUnameprefixSizereadGNUSparseMap0x1readGNUSparseMap1x0readSpecialFileregFileReaderregFileWritersparseArraysparseDatassparseElemsparseEntrysparseFileReadersparseFileWritersparseHolessplitUSTARPathstatAtimestatCtimestatUnixstringFormattersysStattarinsecurepathtoASCIItrailerSTARtryReadFullvalidPAXRecordvalidateSparseEntriesversionGNUversionUSTARzeroBlockzeroReaderzeroWriterlogicalRemainingarchive/tar.logicalRemainingphysicalRemainingarchive/tar.physicalRemainingmayBemayOnlyBemustNotBeTypeflagLinknameUnameGnameAccessTimeChangeTimeDevmajorDevminorXattrsPAXRecordsallowedFormatsendOffsetparseStringparseNumericparseOctaltoV7toGNUtoSTARtoUSTARtoSparsegetFormatsetFormatcomputeChecksumv7groupNamedevMajordevMinoraccessTimechangeTimetrailercurrtwwriteUSTARHeaderwritePAXHeaderwriteGNUHeadertemplateV7PluswriteRawFilewriteRawHeaderAddFSformatStringformatNumericformatOctalfwhandleRegularFilehandleSparseFilereadGNUSparsePAXHeadersreadHeaderreadOldGNUSparseMapSettingsettingChangednonDefaultOncenonDefaultUndocumentedIncNonDefaultherealSizeswchksumtypeFlaglinkNameisExtendedmaxEntriestararchive/tarCompressorDecompressorDeflateErrAlgorithmErrChecksumErrFormatOpenReaderRegisterCompressorRegisterDecompressorchecksumReadercompressorscountWritercreatorFATcreatorMacOSXcreatorNTFScreatorUnixcreatorVFATdataDescriptor64LendataDescriptorLendataDescriptorSignaturedecompressordecompressorsdetectUTF8dirReaderdirWriterdirectory64EndLendirectory64EndSignaturedirectory64LocLendirectory64LocSignaturedirectoryEnddirectoryEndLendirectoryEndSignaturedirectoryHeaderLendirectoryHeaderSignaturedotFileerrLongExtraerrLongNameextTimeExtraIDfileEntryComparefileHeaderLenfileHeaderSignaturefileInfoDirEntryfileListEntryfileModeToUnixModefindDirectory64EndfindSignatureInBlockflateReaderPoolflateWriterPoolinfoZipUnixExtraIDmsDosTimeToTimemsdosDirmsdosModeToFileModemsdosReadOnlynewFlateReadernewFlateWriterntfsExtraIDopenDirpooledFlateReaderpooledFlateWriterreadBufreadDataDescriptorreadDirectory64EndreadDirectoryEndreadDirectoryHeaders_IFBLKs_IFCHRs_IFDIRs_IFIFOs_IFLNKs_IFMTs_IFREGs_IFSOCKs_ISGIDs_ISUIDs_ISVTXtimeToMsDosTimetimeZonetoValidNameuint16maxuint32maxunixExtraIDunixModeToFileModezip64ExtraIDzipVersion20zipVersion45zipinsecurepathNonUTF8CreatorVersionReaderVersionModifiedTimeModifiedDateCRC32CompressedSizeUncompressedSizeCompressedSize64UncompressedSize64ExternalAttrsSetModTimeisZip64hasDataDescriptorzipwrawCountcompcompCountwriteDataDescriptortestHookCloseSizeOffsetSetOffsetSetCommentCreateHeaderCreateRawdiskNbrdirDiskNbrdirRecordsThisDiskdirectoryRecordsdirectorySizedirectoryOffsetcommentLenziprheaderOffsetzip64OpenRawfindBodyOffsetisDupbaseOffsetfileListOnceinitFileListopenLookupopenReadDirnreaddesrarchive/zipErrAdvanceTooFarErrBadReadCountErrBufferFullErrFinalTokenErrInvalidUnreadByteErrInvalidUnreadRuneErrNegativeAdvanceErrNegativeCountErrTooLongMaxScanTokenSizeNewReadWriterNewReaderSizeNewWriterSizeScanBytesScanLinesScanRunesScanWordsdefaultBufSizedropCRerrNegativeReaderrNegativeWriteerrorRuneisSpacemaxConsecutiveEmptyReadsminReadBufferSizestartBufSizeContainsFuncContainsRuneCutCutPrefixCutSuffixErrTooLargeIndexRuneLastIndexAnyLastIndexByteLastIndexFuncMinReadRunesSplitAfterNToLowerSpecialToTitleSpecialToUpperSpecialToValidUTF8TrimFuncTrimRightFuncasciiSetasciiSpacecontainsRuneerrUnreadByteexplodegenSplitgrowSliceindexBytePortableindexFuncisSeparatorlastIndexFuncmakeASCIISetmaxIntopInvalidopReadopReadRune1opReadRune2opReadRune3opReadRune4smallBufferSizetrimLeftASCIItrimLeftBytetrimLeftUnicodetrimRightASCIItrimRightBytetrimRightUnicodeSpecialCaseCaseRangeLoHiDeltaspecialOrderedisNaNBYTEEXABYTEGIGABYTEKILOBYTEMEGABYTEPETABYTETERABYTEToBytesToMegabytesinvalidByteQuantityError/Users/test/Library/Application
